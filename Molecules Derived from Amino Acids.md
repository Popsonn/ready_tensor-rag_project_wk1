# Molecules Derived from Amino Acids

 In addition to their role as the building blocks of proteins, amino acids are precursors of many specialized 
biomolecules, including hormones, coenzymes, nucleotides, alkaloids, cell wall polymers, porphyrins, antibiotics, pigments, and neurotransmitters. We describe 
here the pathways to a number of these amino acid 
derivatives.

## Glycine Is a Precursor of Porphyrins

 The biosynthesis of porphyrins, for which glycine is a 
major precursor, is our first example because of the central importance of the porphyrin nucleus in heme proteins such as hemoglobin and the cytochromes. The 
porphyrins are constructed from four molecules of the 
monopyrrole derivative porphobilinogen, which itself is 
derived from two molecules of -aminolevulinate. There 
are two major pathways to -aminolevulinate. In higher 
eukaryotes (Fig. 22–25a), glycine reacts with succinyl
CoA in the first step to yield -amino--ketoadipate, 
which is then decarboxylated to -aminolevulinate. In 
plants, algae, and most bacteria, -aminolevulinate is 
formed from glutamate (Fig. 22–25b). The glutamate is 
first esterified to glutamyl-tRNAGlu (see Chapter 27 on 
the topic of transfer RNAs); reduction by NADPH con
verts the glutamate to glutamate 1-semialdehyde, which 
is cleaved from the tRNA. An aminotransferase converts 
the glutamate 1-semialdehyde to -aminolevulinate.

 In all organisms, two molecules of -aminolevulinate condense to form porphobilinogen and, through 
a series of complex enzymatic reactions, four molecules 
of porphobilinogen come together to form protoporphyrin (Fig. 22–26). The iron atom is incorporated 
after the protoporphyrin has been assembled, in a step 
catalyzed by ferrochelatase. Porphyrin biosynthesis is 
regulated in higher eukaryotes by heme, which serves 
as a feedback inhibitor of early steps in the synthetic 
pathway. Genetic defects in the biosynthesis of porphyrins can lead to the accumulation of pathway intermediates, causing a variety of human diseases known 
collectively as porphyrias (Box 22–2).

## Heme Is the Source of Bile Pigments

  The iron-porphyrin (heme) group of hemoglobin, released from dying erythrocytes in the 
spleen, is degraded to yield free Fe2 and, ultimately, 
bilirubin. This pathway is arresting for its capacity to 
inject color into human biochemistry.

 The first step in the two-step pathway, catalyzed by 
heme oxygenase, converts heme to biliverdin, a linear 
(open) tetrapyrrole derivative (Fig. 22–27). The other 
products of the reaction are free Fe2 and CO. The Fe2 
is quickly bound by ferritin. Carbon monoxide is a poi
son that binds to hemoglobin (see Box 5–1), and the 
production of CO by heme oxygenase ensures that, 
even in the absence of environmental exposure, about 
1% of an individuals heme is complexed with CO.

 Biliverdin is converted to bilirubin in the second 
step, catalyzed by biliverdin reductase. You can monitor 
this reaction colorimetrically in a familiar in situ experiment. When you are bruised, the black and/or purple 
color results from hemoglobin released from damaged 
erythrocytes. Over time, the color changes to the green 
of biliverdin, and then to the yellow of bilirubin. Bilirubin is largely insoluble, and it travels in the bloodstream 
as a complex with serum albumin. In the liver, bilirubin is 
transformed to the bile pigment bilirubin diglucuronide. 
This product is sufficiently water-soluble to be secreted 
with other components of bile into the small intestine, 
where microbial enzymes convert it to several products, 
predominantly urobilinogen. Some urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the blood and transported to the kidney, 
where it is converted to urobilin, the compound that gives 
urine its yellow color (Fig. 22–27). Urobilinogen remain
ing in the intestine is converted (in another microbe
dependent reaction) to stercobilin (Fig. 22–27), which 
imparts the red-brown color to feces.

Impaired liver function or blocked bile secretion 
causes bilirubin to leak from the liver into the blood, 
resulting in a yellowing of the skin and eyeballs, a condition called jaundice. In cases of jaundice, determination 
of the concentration of bilirubin in the blood may be useful in the diagnosis of underlying liver disease. Newborn 
infants sometimes develop jaundice because they have 
not yet produced enough glucuronyl bilirubin transferase to process their bilirubin. A traditional treatment to 
reduce excess bilirubin, exposure to a fluorescent lamp, 
causes a photochemical conversion of bilirubin to com
pounds that are more soluble and easily excreted.

These pathways of heme breakdown play significant roles in protecting cells from oxidative damage and 
in regulating certain cellular functions. The CO produced by heme oxygenase is toxic at high concentrations, but at the very low concentrations generated 
during heme degradation it seems to have some regulatory and/or signaling functions. It acts as a vasodilator, 
much the same as (but less potent than) nitric oxide 
(discussed below). Low levels of CO also have some 
regulatory effects on neurotransmission. Bilirubin is the 
most abundant antioxidant in mammalian tissues and is 
responsible for most of the antioxidant activity in 
serum. Its protective effects seem to be especially 
important in the developing brain of newborn infants. 
The cell toxicity associated with jaundice may be due to 
bilirubin levels in excess of the serum albumin needed 
to solubilize it. 

Given these varied roles of heme degradation products, the degradative pathway is subject to regulation, 
mainly at the first step. Humans have at least three iso
zymes of heme oxygenase (HO). HO-1 is highly regulated; the expression of its gene is induced by a wide 
range of stress conditions (shear stress, angiogenesis 
(uncontrolled development of blood vessels), hypoxia, 
hyperoxia, heat shock, exposure to ultraviolet light, 
hydrogen peroxide, and many other metabolic insults). 
HO-2 is found mainly in brain and testes, where it is 
continuously expressed. The third isozyme, HO-3, is not 
yet well characterized. 

## Amino Acids Are Precursors of Creatine and Glutathione

 Phosphocreatine, derived from creatine, is an important energy buffer in skeletal muscle (see Box 23–2). 
Creatine is synthesized from glycine and arginine (Fig. 
22–28); methionine, in the form of S-adenosylmethionine, acts as methyl group donor.

 Glutathione (GSH), present in plants, animals, 
and some bacteria, often at high levels, can be thought of as a redox buffer. It is derived from glutamate, cysteine, 
and glycine (Fig. 22–29). The -carboxyl group of glutamate is activated by ATP to form an acyl phosphate 
intermediate, which is then attacked by the -amino 
group of cysteine. A second condensation reaction follows, with the -carboxyl group of cysteine activated to 
an acyl phosphate to permit reaction with glycine. The 
oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG), produced in the 
course of its redox activities, contains two glutathione 
molecules linked by a disulfide bond.

 Glutathione probably helps maintain the sulfhydryl 
groups of proteins in the reduced state and the iron of 
heme in the ferrous (Fe2 ) state, and it serves as a 
reducing agent for glutaredoxin in deoxyribonucleotide 
synthesis (see Fig. 22–41). Its redox function is also used 
to remove toxic peroxides formed in the normal course of 
growth and metabolism under aerobic conditions:
 2 GSH 1 R—O—O—H ¡ GSSG 1 H2O 1 R—OH

 This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, 
a remarkable enzyme in that it contains a covalently 
bound selenium (Se) atom in the form of selenocysteine 
(see Fig. 3–8a), which is essential for its activity.

## D-Amino Acids Are Found Primarily in Bacteria

  Although D-amino acids do not generally occur in 
proteins, they do serve some special functions in 
the structure of bacterial cell walls and peptide antibiotics. Bacterial peptidoglycans (see Fig. 20–30) contain 
both D-alanine and D-glutamate. D-Amino acids arise 
directly from the L isomers by the action of amino acid 
racemases, which have pyridoxal phosphate as cofactor 
(see Fig. 18–6). Amino acid racemization is uniquely 
important to bacterial metabolism, and enzymes such as 
alanine racemase are prime targets for pharmaceutical 
agents. One such agent, L-fluoroalanine, is being tested 
as an antibacterial drug. Another, cycloserine, is used 
to treat tuberculosis. Because these inhibitors also 
affect some PLP-requiring human enzymes, however, 
they have potentially undesirable side effects. 

## Aromatic Amino Acids Are Precursors of Many Plant Substances

 Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are converted 
to a variety of important compounds in plants. The 
rigid polymer lignin, derived from phenylalanine and 
tyrosine, is second only to cellulose in abundance in 
plant tissues. The structure of the lignin polymer is 
complex and not well understood. Tryptophan is also 
the precursor of the plant growth hormone indole-3
acetate, or auxin (Fig. 22–30a), which is important  in the regulation of a wide range of biological processes 
in plants.

 Phenylalanine and tyrosine also give rise to many 
commercially significant natural products, including 
the tannins that inhibit oxidation in wines; alkaloids 
such as morphine, which have potent physiological 
effects; and the flavoring of cinnamon oil (Fig. 22–30b), 
nutmeg, cloves, vanilla, cayenne pepper, and other 
products.

## Biological Amines Are Products of Amino Acid Decarboxylation

  Many important neurotransmitters are primary 
or secondary amines, derived from amino acids 
in simple pathways. In addition, some polyamines that form complexes with DNA are derived from the amino 
acid ornithine, a component of the urea cycle. A com
mon denominator of many of these pathways is amino 
acid decarboxylation, another PLP-requiring reaction 
(see Fig. 18–6).

 The synthesis of some neurotransmitters is illustrated in Figure 22–31. Tyrosine gives rise to a family 
of catecholamines that includes dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Levels of catecholamines 
are correlated with, among other things, changes in 
blood pressure. The neurological disorder Parkinson 
disease is associated with an underproduction of dopa
mine, and it has traditionally been treated by administering L-dopa. Overproduction of dopamine in the brain 
may be linked to psychological disorders such as 
schizophrenia.

 Glutamate decarboxylation gives rise to -amino
butyrate (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Its 
underproduction is associated with epileptic seizures. 
GABA analogs are used in the treatment of epilepsy and 
hypertension. Levels of GABA can also be increased by 
administering inhibitors of the GABA-degrading enzyme 
GABA aminotransferase. Another important neurotransmitter, serotonin, is derived from tryptophan in a two
step pathway.

 Histidine undergoes decarboxylation to histamine, 
a powerful vasodilator in animal tissues. Histamine is 
released in large amounts as part of the allergic response, 
and it also stimulates acid secretion in the stomach. A 
growing array of pharmaceutical agents are being 
designed to interfere with either the synthesis or the 
action of histamine. A prominent example is the histamine receptor antagonist cimetidine (Tagamet), a 
structural analog of histamine:
 CH3
 C
 NH CH2
 N
 CH2 CH2
 NH
 S NH CH3
 N
 C
 N

 It promotes the healing of duodenal ulcers by inhibiting 
secretion of gastric acid.

 Polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, 
involved in DNA packaging, are derived from methionine and ornithine by the pathway shown in Figure 
22–32. The first step is decarboxylation of ornithine, a 
precursor of arginine (Fig. 22–12). Ornithine decarboxylase, a PLP-requiring enzyme, is the target of 
several powerful inhibitors used as pharmaceutical 
agents (see Box 6–3). 

## Arginine Is the Precursor for Biological Synthesis of Nitric Oxide

 A surprise finding in the mid-1980s was the role of nitric 
oxide (NO)—previously known mainly as a component 
of smog—as an important biological messenger. This 
simple gaseous substance diffuses readily through 
membranes, although its high reactivity limits its range 
of diffusion to about a 1 mm radius from the site of syn
thesis. In humans NO plays a role in a range of physio
logical processes, including neurotransmission, blood 
clotting, and the control of blood pressure. Its mode of 
action is described in Chapter 12 (see Section 12.4).

 Nitric oxide is synthesized from arginine in an 
NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide 
synthase (Fig. 22–33), a dimeric enzyme structurally 
related to NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (see 
Box 21–1). The reaction is a five-electron oxidation. 
Each subunit of the enzyme contains one bound molecule of each of four different cofactors: FMN, FAD, tetrahydrobiopterin, and Fe3 heme. NO is an unstable 
molecule and cannot be stored. Its synthesis is stimulated by interaction of nitric oxide synthase with Ca2
calmodulin (see Fig. 12–11).

## SUMMARY 22.3 Molecules Derived from Amino Acids

 Many important biomolecules are derived from 
amino acids. Glycine is a precursor of porphyrins. 
Degradation of iron-porphyrin (heme) generates 
bilirubin, which is converted to bile pigments, with 
several physiological functions.

Glycine and arginine give rise to creatine and 
phosphocreatine, an energy buffer. Glutathione, 
formed from three amino acids, is an important 
cellular reducing agent.

 Bacteria synthesize D-amino acids from L-amino 
acids in racemization reactions requiring pyridoxal 
phosphate. D-Amino acids are commonly found in 
certain bacterial walls and certain antibiotics.

 The aromatic amino acids give rise to many plant 
substances. The PLP-dependent decarboxylation 
of some amino acids yields important biological 
amines, including neurotransmitters.

 Arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide, a 
biological messenger.
