# Biosynthesis of Amino Acids, Nucleotides, and Related Molecules

Nitrogen ranks behind only carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen in its contribution to the mass of living systems. Most of this nitrogen is bound up in amino 
acids and nucleotides. In this chapter we address all 
aspects of the metabolism of these nitrogen-containing 
compounds except amino acid catabolism, which is covered in Chapter 18.

 Discussing the biosynthetic pathways for amino acids 
and nucleotides together is a sound approach, not only 
because both classes of molecules contain nitrogen (which 
arises from common biological sources) but because the 
two sets of pathways are extensively intertwined, with 
several key intermediates in common. Certain amino acids 
or parts of amino acids are incorporated into the structure 
of purines and pyrimidines, and in one case part of a 
purine ring is incorporated into an amino acid (histidine). 
The two sets of pathways also share much common chemistry, in particular a preponderance of reactions involving 
the transfer of nitrogen or one-carbon groups.

 The pathways described here can be intimidating to 
the beginning biochemistry student. Their complexity 
arises not so much from the chemistry itself, which in 
many cases is well understood, but from the sheer number of steps and variety of intermediates. These pathways 
are best approached by maintaining a focus on metabolic 
principles we have already discussed, on key intermediates and precursors, and on common classes of reactions. 
Even a cursory look at the chemistry can be rewarding, 
for some of the most unusual chemical transformations in 
biological systems occur in these pathways; for instance, 
we find prominent examples of the rare biological use of the metals molybdenum, selenium, and vanadium. The 
effort also offers a practical dividend, especially for students of human or veterinary medicine. Many genetic 
diseases of humans and animals have been traced to an 
absence of one or more enzymes of amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, and many pharmaceuticals in common 
use to combat infectious diseases are inhibitors of enzymes 
in these pathwaysâ€”as are a number of the most important agents in cancer chemotherapy.

 Regulation is crucial in the biosynthesis of the 
nitrogen-containing compounds. Because each amino 
acid and each nucleotide is required in relatively small 
amounts, the metabolic flow through most of these path
ways is not nearly as great as the biosynthetic flow leading to carbohydrate or fat in animal tissues. Because the 
different amino acids and nucleotides must be made in 
the correct ratios and at the right time for protein and 
nucleic acid synthesis, their biosynthetic pathways must 
be accurately regulated and coordinated with each 
other. And because amino acids and nucleotides are 
charged molecules, their levels must be regulated to 
maintain electrochemical balance in the cell. As dis
cussed in earlier chapters, pathways can be controlled 
by changes in either the activity or the amounts of specific enzymes. The pathways we encounter in this chapter provide some of the best-understood examples of the 
regulation of enzyme activity. Control of the amounts of 
different enzymes in a cell (that is, of their synthesis and 
degradation) is a topic covered in Chapter 28.
