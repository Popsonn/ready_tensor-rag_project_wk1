itrogen ranks behind only carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen in its contribution to the mass of living sys-
tems. Most of this nitrogen is bound up in amino 
acids and nucleotides. In this chapter we address all 
aspects of the metabolism of these nitrogen-containing 
compounds except amino acid catabolism, which is cov-
ered in Chapter 18.
 
Discussing the biosynthetic pathways for amino acids 
and nucleotides together is a sound approach, not only 
because both classes of molecules contain nitrogen (which 
arises from common biological sources) but because the 
two sets of pathways are extensively intertwined, with 
several key intermediates in common. Certain amino acids 
or parts of amino acids are incorporated into the structure 
of purines and pyrimidines, and in one case part of a 
purine ring is incorporated into an amino acid (histidine). 
The two sets of pathways also share much common chem-
istry, in particular a preponderance of reactions involving 
the transfer of nitrogen or one-carbon groups.
 
The pathways described here can be intimidating to 
the beginning biochemistry student. Their complexity 
arises not so much from the chemistry itself, which in 
many cases is well understood, but from the sheer num-
ber of steps and variety of intermediates. These pathways 
are best approached by maintaining a focus on metabolic 
principles we have already discussed, on key intermedi-
ates and precursors, and on common classes of reactions. 
Even a cursory look at the chemistry can be rewarding, 
for some of the most unusual chemical transformations in 
biological systems occur in these pathways; for instance, 
we find prominent examples of the rare biological use of 
the metals molybdenum, selenium, and vanadium. The 
effort also offers a practical dividend, especially for stu-
dents of human or veterinary medicine. Many genetic 
diseases of humans and animals have been traced to an 
absence of one or more enzymes of amino acid and nucle-
otide metabolism, and many pharmaceuticals in common 
use to combat infectious diseases are inhibitors of enzymes 
in these pathways—as are a number of the most impor-
tant agents in cancer chemotherapy.
 
Regulation is crucial in the biosynthesis of the 
nitrogen-containing compounds. Because each amino 
acid and each nucleotide is required in relatively small 
amounts, the metabolic flow through most of these path-
ways is not nearly as great as the biosynthetic flow lead-
ing to carbohydrate or fat in animal tissues. Because the 
different amino acids and nucleotides must be made in 
the correct ratios and at the right time for protein and 
nucleic acid synthesis, their biosynthetic pathways must 
be accurately regulated and coordinated with each 
other. And because amino acids and nucleotides are 
charged molecules, their levels must be regulated to 
maintain electrochemical balance in the cell. As dis-
cussed in earlier chapters, pathways can be controlled 
by changes in either the activity or the amounts of spe-
cific enzymes. The pathways we encounter in this chap-
ter provide some of the best-understood examples of the 
regulation of enzyme activity. Control of the amounts of 
different enzymes in a cell (that is, of their synthesis and 
degradation) is a topic covered in Chapter 28.
22.1 Overview of Nitrogen Metabolism
The biosynthetic pathways leading to amino acids and 
nucleotides share a requirement for nitrogen. Because 
soluble, biologically useful nitrogen compounds are gen-
erally scarce in natural environments, most organisms 
maintain strict economy in their use of ammonia, amino 
acids, and nucleotides. Indeed, as we shall see, free

NH3-to-N2 conversion in the biosphere may occur 
through this pathway, undetected until the 1980s. The 
obligate anaerobes that promote anammox are fasci-
nating in their own right and are providing some useful 
solutions to waste-treatment problems (Box 22–1).
 
Now let’s examine the processes that generate the 
ammonia that is incorporated into microorganisms, 
plants, and the animals that eat them.
 
More than 90% of the NH
4  generated by vascular 
plants, algae, and microorganisms comes from nitrate 
assimilation, a two-step process. First NO
3  is reduced to 
NO
2  by nitrate reductase, then the NO
2  is reduced to 
NH
4 in a six-electron transfer catalyzed by nitrite 
reductase (Fig. 22–2). Both reactions involve chains 
of electron carriers and cofactors we have not yet 
encountered. Nitrate reductase is a large, soluble pro-
tein (Mr 220,000). Within the enzyme, a pair of elec-
trons, donated by NADH, flows through —SH groups of 
cysteine, FAD, and a cytochrome (cyt b557), then to a 
novel cofactor containing molybdenum, before reducing 
the substrate NO3
 to NO2
.
 
The nitrite reductase of plants is located in the 
chloroplasts and receives its electrons from ferredoxin 
(which is reduced in the light-dependent reactions of 
photosynthesis; see Section 19.8). Six electrons, donat-
ed one at a time by ferredoxin, pass through a 4S-4Fe 
center in the enzyme, then through a novel heme-like 
molecule (siroheme) before reducing NO
2 to NH
4 
(Fig. 22–2). In nonphotosynthetic microbes, NADPH 
provides the electrons for this reaction.
Nitrogen Is Fixed by Enzymes of the 
Nitrogenase Complex
Only certain bacteria and archaea can fix atmospheric 
N2. These organisms, called diazotrophs, include the 
cyanobacteria of soils and fresh and salt waters, metha-
nogenic archaea (strict anaerobes that obtain energy 
and carbon by converting H2 and CO2 to methane), other 
kinds of free-living soil bacteria such as Azotobacter spe-
cies, and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria that live as symbi-
onts in the root nodules of leguminous plants. The first 
important product of nitrogen fixation is ammonia, 
amino acids, purines, and pyrimidines formed during 
metabolic turnover of proteins and nucleic acids are 
often salvaged and reused. We first examine the path-
ways by which nitrogen from the environment is intro-
duced into biological systems.
The Nitrogen Cycle Maintains a Pool 
of Biologically Available Nitrogen
Although Earth’s atmosphere is four-fifths molecular 
nitrogen (N2), relatively few species can convert this 
atmospheric nitrogen into forms useful to living organ-
isms. In the biosphere, the metabolic processes of differ-
ent species function interdependently to salvage and 
reuse biologically available nitrogen in a vast nitrogen 
cycle (Fig. 22–1). The first step in the cycle is fixation 
(reduction) of atmospheric nitrogen by nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria to yield ammonia (NH3 or NH
4). Although 
ammonia can be used by most living organisms, soil bac-
teria that derive their energy by oxidizing ammonia to 
nitrite (NO
2) and ultimately nitrate (NO
3) are so abun-
dant and active that nearly all ammonia reaching the soil 
is oxidized to nitrate. This process is known as nitrifica-
tion. Plants and many bacteria can take up and readily 
reduce nitrate and nitrite to ammonia through the action 
of nitrate and nitrite reductases. This ammonia is incor-
porated into amino acids by plants. Animals then use 
plants as a source of amino acids, both nonessential and 
essential, to build their proteins. When organisms die, 
microbial degradation of their proteins returns ammonia 
to the soil, where nitrifying bacteria again convert it to 
nitrite and nitrate. A balance is maintained between 
fixed nitrogen and atmospheric nitrogen by bacteria that 
reduce nitrate to N2 under anaerobic conditions, a pro-
cess called denitrification (Fig. 22–1). These soil bac-
teria use NO
3 rather than O2 as the ultimate electron 
acceptor in a series of reactions that (like oxidative 
phosphorylation) generates a transmembrane proton 
gradient, which is used to synthesize ATP.
 
The nitrogen cycle is short-circuited by a group of 
bacteria that promote anaerobic ammonia oxidation, or 
anammox (Fig. 22–1), a process that converts ammo-
nia and nitrite to N2. As much as 50% to 70% of the 
FIGURE 22–1 The nitrogen cycle. The total amount of nitrogen fixed annually in the biosphere exceeds 1011 kg. Reactions

binding sites for ATP/ADP (one site on each subunit). 
Dinitrogenase (Mr 240,000), an 22 tetramer, has two 
Fe-containing cofactors that transfer electrons (Fig. 
22–3b). One, the P cluster, has a pair of 4Fe-4S centers; 
these share a sulfur atom, making an 8Fe-7S center. The 
second cofactor in dinitrogenase, the FeMo cofactor, is 
a novel structure composed of 7 Fe atoms, 9 inorganic S 
atoms, a Cys side chain, and a single carbon atom in the 
center of the FeS cluster. Also part of the cofactor is a 
molybdenum atom, with ligands that include three inor-
ganic S atoms, a His side chain, and two oxygen atoms 
from a molecule of homocitrate that is an intrinsic part 
of the FeMo cofactor. There is also a form of nitrogenase 
that contains vanadium rather than molybdenum, and 
some bacterial species can produce both types. The 
vanadium-containing enzyme may be the primary 
nitrogen-fixing system under some conditions. The 
vanadium nitrogenase of Azotobacter vinelandii has the 
remarkable capacity to catalyze the reduction of carbon 
monoxide (CO) to ethylene (C2H4), ethane, and propane. 
 
Nitrogen fixation is carried out by a highly reduced 
form of dinitrogenase and requires eight electrons: six 
for the reduction of N2 and two to produce one molecule 
of H2. Production of H2 is an obligate part of the reaction 
mechanism, but its biological role in the process is not 
understood. 
 
Dinitrogenase is reduced by the transfer of elec-
trons from dinitrogenase reductase (Fig. 22–4). The 
dinitrogenase tetramer has two binding sites for the 
reductase. The required eight electrons are transferred 
from reductase to dinitrogenase one at a time: a reduced 
reductase molecule binds to the dinitrogenase and 
transfers a single electron, then the oxidized reductase 
which can be used by all organisms either directly or 
after its conversion to other soluble compounds such as 
nitrites, nitrates, or amino acids.
 
The reduction of nitrogen to ammonia is an exer-
gonic reaction:
N2 1 3H2 ¡ 2NH3  G98 5 233.5 kJ/mol
The N;N triple bond, however, is very stable, with a 
bond energy of 930 kJ/mol. Nitrogen fixation therefore 
has an extremely high activation energy, and atmo-
spheric nitrogen is almost chemically inert under nor-
mal conditions. Ammonia is produced industrially by 
the Haber process (named for its inventor, Fritz Haber), 
which requires temperatures of 400 to 500 8C and nitro-
gen and hydrogen at pressures of tens of thousands of 
kilopascals (several hundred atmospheres) to provide 
the necessary activation energy. Biological nitrogen 
fixation, however, must occur at biological tempera-
tures and at 0.8 atm of nitrogen, and the high activation 
barrier is overcome by other means. This is accom-
plished, at least in part, by the binding and hydrolysis of 
ATP. The overall reaction can be written
N2 1 10H1 1 8e2 1 16ATP ¡
2NH1
4 1 16ADP 1 16Pi 1 H2
 
Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out by a highly 
conserved complex of proteins called the nitrogenase 
complex; its central components are dinitrogenase 
reductase and dinitrogenase (Fig. 22–3a). Dinitro-
genase reductase (Mr 60,000) is a dimer of two identical 
subunits. It contains a single 4Fe-4S redox center (see 
Fig. 19–5), bound between the subunits, and can be 
oxidized and reduced by one electron. It also has two

Unusual Lifestyles of the Obscure but Abundant
FIGURE 1 The anammox reactions. Ammonia and hydroxy-
lamine are converted to hydrazine and H2O by hydrazine 
hydrolase, and the hydrazine is oxidized by hydrazine-
oxidizing enzyme, generating N2 and protons. The pro-
tons generate a proton gradient for ATP synthesis. On 
the anammoxosome exterior, protons are used by the 
nitrite-reducing enzyme, producing hydroxy lamine and 
completing the cycle. All of the anammox enzymes are 
embedded in the anammoxosome membrane.
Air-breathers that we are, we can easily overlook the 
bacteria and archaea that thrive in anaerobic environ-
ments. Although rarely featured in introductory bio-
chemistry textbooks, these organisms constitute 
much of the biomass of this planet, and their contri-
butions to the balance of carbon and nitrogen in the 
biosphere are essential to all forms of life.
 
As detailed in earlier chapters, the energy used to 
maintain living systems relies on the generation of 
proton gradients across membranes. Electrons derived 
from a reduced substrate are made available to elec-
tron carriers in membranes and pass through a series 
of electron transfers to a final electron acceptor. As a 
byproduct of this process, protons are released on one 
side of the membrane, generating the transmembrane 
proton gradient. The proton gradient is used to syn-
thesize ATP or to drive other energy-requiring pro-
cesses. For all eukaryotes, the reduced substrate is 
generally a carbohydrate (glucose or pyruvate) or a 
fatty acid and the electron acceptor is oxygen.
 
Many bacteria and archaea are much more versatile. 
In anaerobic environments such as marine and freshwa-
ter sediments, the variety of life strategies is extraordi-
nary. Almost any available redox pair can be an energy 
source for some specialized organism or group of organ-
isms. For example, a large number of lithotrophic bacte-
ria (a lithotroph is a chemotroph that uses inorganic 
energy sources; see Fig. 1–5) have a hydrogenase that 
uses molecular hydrogen to reduce NAD:
H2  NAD 
hydrogenase
  NADH  H
The NADH is a source of electrons for a variety of 
membrane-bound electron acceptors, generating the 
proton gradient needed for ATP synthesis. Other litho-
trophs oxidize sulfur compounds (H2S, elemental sul-
fur, or thiosulfate) or ferrous iron. A widespread group 
of archaea called methanogens, all strict anaerobes, 
extract energy from the reduction of CO2 to methane. 
And this is just a small sampling of what anaerobic 
organisms do for a living. Their metabolic pathways are 
replete with interesting reactions and highly specialized 
cofactors unknown in our own world of obligate aerobic 
metabolism. Study of these organisms can yield practi-
cal dividends. It can also provide clues about the origins 
of life on an early Earth, in an atmosphere that lacked 
molecular oxygen.
 
The nitrogen cycle depends on a wide range of spe-
cialized bacteria. There are two groups of nitrifying 
bacteria: those that oxidize ammonia to nitrites and 
those that oxidize the resulting nitrites to nitrates (see 
Fig. 22–1). Nitrate is second only to O2 as a biological 
electron acceptor, and a great many bacteria and 
archaea can catalyze the denitrification of nitrates to 
nitrogen, which the nitrogen-fixing bacteria then con-
vert back into ammonia. Ammonia is a major pollutant in 
sewage and in farm animal waste, and is a byproduct of 
fertilizer manufacture and oil refining. Waste-treatment 
plants have generally made use of communities of nitri-
fying and denitrifying bacteria to convert ammonia 
waste to atmospheric nitrogen. The process is expen-
sive, requiring inputs of organic carbon and oxygen.
 
In the 1960s and 1970s, a few articles appeared in 
the research literature suggesting that ammonia 
could be oxidized to nitrogen anaerobically, using 
nitrite as an electron acceptor; this process was called 
anammox. The reports received little notice until bac-
teria promoting anammox were discovered in a waste-
treatment system in Delft, the Netherlands, in the 
mid-1980s. A team of Dutch microbiologists led by 
Gijs Kuenen and Mike Jetten began to study these 
bacteria, which were soon identified as belonging to 
an unusual bacterial phylum, Planctomycetes. Some 
surprises were to follow.

cess was slowly unraveled (Fig. 1). Hydrazine (N2H4),

a highly reactive molecule used as a rocket fuel, was 
an unexpected intermediate. As a small molecule, 
hydrazine is both highly toxic and difficult to con-
tain. It readily diffuses across typical phospholipid 
membranes. The anammox bacteria solve this prob-
lem by sequestering hydrazine in a specialized 
organelle, dubbed the anammoxosome. The mem-
brane of this organelle is composed of lipids known 
as ladderanes (Fig. 2), never before encountered 
in biology. The fused cyclobutane rings of ladder-
anes stack tightly to form a very dense barrier, 
greatly slowing the release of hydrazine. Cyclobu-
tane rings are strained and difficult to synthesize; 
the bacterial mechanisms for synthesizing these 
lipids are not yet known.
 
The anammoxosome was a surprising finding. 
Bacterial cells generally do not have compartments, 
and the lack of a membrane-enclosed nucleus is often 
cited as the primary distinction between eukaryotes 
and bacteria. One type of organelle in a bacterium 
was interesting enough, but planctomycetes also 
have a nucleus: their chromosomal DNA is contained 
within a membrane (Fig. 3). Discovery of this subcel-
lular organization has prompted further research to 
trace the origin of the planctomycetes and the evolu-
tion of eukaryotic nuclei. Planctomycetes are an 
ancient bacterial line with multiple genera, three of 
which are known to carry out the anammox reac-
tions. Further study of this group may ultimately 
bring us closer to a key goal of evolutionary biology: 
a description of the organism affectionately referred 
to as LUCA—the last universal common ancestor of 
all life on our planet.
 
For now, the anammox bacteria offer a major 
advance in waste treatment, reducing the cost of 
ammonia removal by as much as 90% (the conven-
tional denitrification steps are eliminated completely, 
and the aeration costs associated with nitrification are 
lower) and reducing the release of polluting byprod-
ucts. Clearly, a greater familiarity with the bacterial 
underpinnings of the biosphere can pay big dividends 
as we deal with the environmental challenges of the 
twenty-first century.

dissociates from dinitrogenase, in a repeating cycle. 
Each turn of the cycle requires the hydrolysis of two 
ATP molecules by the dimeric reductase. The immediate 
source of electrons to reduce dinitrogenase reductase 
varies, with reduced ferredoxin (see Section 19.8), 
reduced flavodoxin, and perhaps other sources playing a 
role. In at least one species, the ultimate source of elec-
trons to reduce ferredoxin is pyruvate (Fig. 22–4).
 
The role of ATP in this process is somewhat unusual. 
Recall that ATP can contribute not only chemical energy, 
through the hydrolysis of one or more of its phosphoan-
hydride bonds, but also binding energy (p. 195), 
through noncovalent interactions that lower the activa-
tion energy. In the reaction carried out by dinitrogenase 
reductase, both ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis bring 
about protein conformational changes that help over-
come the high activation energy of nitrogen fixation. The 
binding of two ATP molecules to the reductase shifts the 
reduction potential (E98) of this protein from 2300 to 
2420 mV, an enhancement of its reducing power that is

required to transfer electrons through dinitrogenase to 
N2; the standard reduction potential for the half-reaction 
N2 1 6H 1 6e ¡ 2NH3 is 20.34 V. The ATP mole-
cules are then hydrolyzed just before the actual transfer 
of one electron to dinitrogenase.
 
ATP binding and hydrolysis change the conforma-
tion of nitrogenase reductase in two regions, which are 
structurally homologous with switch 1 and switch 2 
regions of the GTP-binding proteins involved in biologi-
cal signaling (see Box 12–2). ATP binding produces a 
conformational change that brings the 4Fe-4S center of 
the reductase closer to the P cluster of dinitrogenase 
(from 18 Å to 14 Å away), which facilitates electron 
transfer between the reductase and dinitrogenase. The 
details of electron transfer from the P cluster to the 
FeMo cofactor, and the means by which eight electrons 
are accumulated by nitrogenase, are not known, nor are 
the intermediates in the reaction known with certainty; 
two reasonable hypotheses are being tested, both 
involving the Mo atom as a central player (Fig. 22–5).
 
The nitrogenase complex is remarkably unstable in 
the presence of oxygen. The reductase is inactivated in 
air, with a half-life of 30 seconds; dinitrogenase has a 
half-life of only 10 minutes in air. Free-living bacteria 
that fix nitrogen cope with this problem in a variety of 
ways. Some live only anaerobically or repress nitroge-
nase synthesis when oxygen is present. Some aerobic 
species, such as Azotobacter vinelandii, partially 
uncouple electron transfer from ATP synthesis so that 
oxygen is burned off as rapidly as it enters the cell (see 
Box 19–1). When fixing nitrogen, cultures of these bac-
teria actually increase in temperature as a result of their 
efforts to rid themselves of oxygen.
 
The symbiotic relationship between leguminous 
plants and the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in their root nod-
ules (Fig. 22–6) takes care of both the energy require-
ments and the oxygen lability of the nitrogenase complex. 
The energy required for nitrogen fixation was probably 
the evolutionary driving force for this plant-bacteria asso-
ciation. The bacteria in root nodules have access to a large 
FIGURE 22–5 Two reasonable hypotheses for the intermediates involved 
in N2 reduction. In both scenarios, the FeMo cofactor (abbreviated as M 
here) plays a central role, binding directly to one of the nitrogen atoms of 
N2 and remaining bound throughout the sequence of reduction steps.

provide the critical entry point. Recall that these same 
two amino acids play central roles in the catabolism of 
ammonia and amino groups in amino acid oxidation 
(Chapter 18). Glutamate is the source of amino groups for 
most other amino acids, through transamination reactions 
(the reverse of the reaction shown in Fig. 18–4). The 
amide nitrogen of glutamine is a source of amino groups 
in a wide range of biosynthetic processes. In most types of 
cells, and in extracellular fluids in higher organisms, one 
or both of these amino acids are present at higher concen-
trations—sometimes an order of magnitude or more 
higher—than other amino acids. An Escherichia coli cell 
requires so much glutamate that this amino acid is one of 
the primary solutes in the cytosol. Its concentration is 
regulated not only in response to the cell’s nitrogen 
requirements but also to maintain an osmotic balance 
between the cytosol and the external medium.
 
The biosynthetic pathways to glutamate and gluta-
mine are simple, and all or some of the steps occur in most 
organisms. The most important pathway for the assimila-
tion of NH
4 into glutamate requires two reactions. First, 
glutamine synthetase catalyzes the reaction of gluta-
mate and NH
4 to yield glutamine. This reaction takes 
place in two steps, with enzyme-bound -glutamyl phos-
phate as an intermediate (see Fig. 18–8):
(1) 
Glutamate 1 ATP ¡ 
-glutamyl phosphate 1 ADP
(2)  
-Glutamyl phosphate 1 NH
4 ¡ 
glutamine 1 Pi 1 H
Sum: Glutamate 1 NH
4 1 ATP ¡ 
 
glutamine 1 ADP 1 Pi 1 H (22–1)
Glutamine synthetase is found in all organisms. In addi-
tion to its importance for NH
4 assimilation in bacteria, it 
has a central role in amino acid metabolism in mammals, 
converting free NH
4, which is toxic, to glutamine for 
transport in the blood (Chapter 18).
 
In bacteria and plants, glutamate is produced from 
glutamine in a reaction catalyzed by glutamate syn-
thase. (An alternative name for this enzyme, glutamate:
oxoglutarate aminotransferase, yields the acronym 
GOGAT, by which the enzyme also is known.) -Ketoglu-
tarate, an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, undergoes 
reductive amination with glutamine as nitrogen donor:
-Ketoglutarate 1 glutamine 1 NADPH 1 H ¡ 
 
2 glutamate 1 NADP 
(22–2)
The net reaction of glutamine synthetase and glutamate 
synthase (Eqns 22–1 and 22–2) is
-Ketoglutarate 1 NH
4 1 NADPH 1 ATP ¡ 
L-glutamate 1 NADP 1 ADP 1 Pi
Glutamate synthase is not present in animals, which 
instead maintain high levels of glutamate by processes 
such as the transamination of -ketoglutarate during 
amino acid catabolism.
 
Glutamate can also be formed in yet another, albeit 
minor, pathway: the reaction of -ketoglutarate and 
NH
4 to form glutamate in one step. This is catalyzed by 
conditions generally encountered in soils. To solve the 
oxygen-toxicity problem, the bacteria in root nodules are 
bathed in a solution of the oxygen-binding heme protein 
leghemoglobin, produced by the plant (although the 
heme may be contributed by the bacteria). Leghemoglo-
bin binds all available oxygen so that it cannot interfere 
with nitrogen fixation, and efficiently delivers the oxygen 
to the bacterial electron-transfer system. The benefit to 
the plant, of course, is a ready supply of reduced nitro-
gen. In fact, the bacterial symbionts typically produce far 
more NH3 than is needed by their symbiotic partner; the 
excess is released into the soil. The efficiency of the sym-
biosis between plants and bacteria is evident in the 
enrichment of soil nitrogen brought about by leguminous 
plants. This enrichment of NH3 in the soil is the basis of 
crop rotation methods, in which plantings of nonlegumi-
nous plants (such as maize) that extract fixed nitrogen 
from the soil are alternated every few years with plant-
ings of legumes such as alfalfa, peas, or clover.
 
Nitrogen fixation is energetically costly: 16 ATP and 
8 electron pairs yield only 2 NH3. It is therefore not sur-
prising that the process is tightly regulated, so that NH3 is 
produced only when needed. High [ADP], an indicator of 
low [ATP], is a strong inhibitor of nitrogenase. NH4
 
represses the expression of the 20 nitrogen fixation 
(nif ) genes, effectively shutting down the pathway. 
Covalent alteration of nitrogenase is also used in some 
diazotrophs to control nitrogen fixation in response to the 
availability of NH
4 in the surroundings. Transfer of an 
ADP-ribosyl group from NADH to a specific Arg residue in 
the nitrogenase reductase shuts down N2 fixation in Rho-
dospirillum, for example. This is the same covalent 
modification that we saw in the case of G protein inhibi-
tion by the toxins of cholera and pertussis (see Box 12–2).
 
Nitrogen fixation is the subject of intense study 
because of its immense practical importance. Industrial 
production of ammonia for use in fertilizers requires a 
large and expensive input of energy, and this has 
spurred a drive to develop recombinant or transgenic 
organisms that can fix nitrogen. In principle, recombi-
nant DNA techniques (Chapter 9) might be used to 
transfer the DNA that encodes the enzymes of nitrogen 
fixation into non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria and plants. 
However, those genes alone will not suffice. About 20 
genes are essential to nitrogenase activity in bacteria, 
many of them needed for the synthesis, assembly, and 
insertion of the cofactors. There is also the problem of 
protecting the enzyme in its new setting from destruc-
tion by oxygen. In all, there are formidable challenges in 
engineering new nitrogen-fixing plants. Success in 
these efforts will depend on overcoming the problem of 
oxygen toxicity in any cell that produces nitrogenase.
Ammonia Is Incorporated into Biomolecules through 
Glutamate and Glutamine
Reduced nitrogen in the form of NH
4 is assimilated into 
amino acids and then into other nitrogen-containing bio-
molecules. Two amino acids, glutamate and glutamine, 
22.1 Overview of Nitrogen Metabolism 
889
six end products of glutamine metabolism are allosteric 
inhibitors of the enzyme (Fig. 22–8). Each inhibitor 
alone produces only partial inhibition, but the effects of 
multiple inhibitors are more than additive, and all eight 
together virtually shut down the enzyme. This is an 
example of cumulative feedback inhibition. This control 
mechanism provides a constant adjustment of glutamine 
levels to match immediate metabolic requirements.
 
Superimposed on the allosteric regulation is inhibi-
tion by adenylylation of (addition of AMP to) Tyr397, 
located near the enzyme’s active site (Fig. 22–9). This 
covalent modification increases sensitivity to the allo-
steric inhibitors, and activity decreases as more sub-
units are adenylylated. Both adenylylation and deade-
nylylation are promoted by adenylyltransferase (AT 
in Fig. 22–9), part of a complex enzymatic cascade that 
responds to levels of glutamine, -ketoglutarate, ATP, 
and Pi. The activity of adenylyltransferase is modulated 
by binding to a regulatory protein called PII, and the 
activity of PII, in turn, is regulated by covalent modifica-
tion (uridylylation), again at a Tyr residue. The adenyl-
yltransferase complex with uridylylated PII (PII-UMP) 
stimulates deadenylylation, whereas the same complex 
with deuridylylated PII stimulates adenylylation of gluta-
mine synthetase. Both uridylylation and deuridylylation 
of PII are brought about by a single enzyme, uridylyl-
transferase. Uridylylation is inhibited by binding of 
glutamine and Pi to uridylyltransferase and is stimulated 
by binding of -ketoglutarate and ATP to PII.
 
The regulation does not stop there. The uridylylated 
PII also mediates the activation of transcription of the 
gene encoding glutamine synthetase, thus increasing the 
cellular concentration of the enzyme; the deuridylylated 
L-glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme present in all 
organisms. Reducing power is furnished by NADPH:
-Ketoglutarate 1 NH
4 1 NADPH ¡ 
L-glutamate 1 NADP 1 H2O
We encountered this reaction in the catabolism of amino 
acids (see Fig. 18–7). In eukaryotic cells, L-glutamate 
dehydrogenase is located in the mitochondrial matrix. 
The reaction equilibrium favors the reactants, and the Km 
for NH
4  (1 mM) is so high that the reaction probably 
makes only a modest contribution to NH4
 assimilation 
into amino acids and other metabolites. (Recall that the 
glutamate dehydrogenase reaction, in reverse (see Fig. 
18–10), is one source of NH
4 destined for the urea 
cycle.) Concentrations of NH4
 high enough for the gluta-
mate dehydrogenase reaction to make a significant con-
tribution to glutamate levels generally occur only when 
NH3 is added to the soil or when organisms are grown in 
a laboratory in the presence of high NH3 concentrations. 
In general, soil bacteria and plants rely on the two-
enzyme pathway outlined above (Eqns. 22–1, 22–2).
Glutamine Synthetase Is a Primary Regulatory 
Point in Nitrogen Metabolism
The activity of glutamine synthetase is regulated in vir-
tually all organisms—as expected, given its central met-
abolic role as an entry point for reduced nitrogen. In 
enteric bacteria such as E. coli, the regulation is unusu-
ally complex. Type I enzyme (from bacteria) has 12 
identical subunits of Mr 50,000 (Fig. 22–7) and is regu-
lated both allosterically and by covalent modification. 
(Type II enzyme, from eukaryotes and some bacteria, 
has 10 identical subunits.) Alanine, glycine, and at least 
FIGURE 22–7 Subunit structure of bacterial type I glutamine synthetase. 
(PDB ID 2GLS) This view shows 6 of 12 the identical subunits; a second 
layer of 6 subunits lies directly beneath the six shown. Each of the 12 sub-
units has an active site, where ATP and glutamate are bound in orienta-
tions that favor transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to the side-chain 
carboxyl of glutamate. In this crystal structure, ADP occupies the ATP site.
FIGURE 22–8 Allosteric regulation of glutamine synthetase. The 
enzyme undergoes cumulative regulation by six end products of gluta-
mine metabolism. Alanine and glycine probably serve as indicators of 
the general status of amino acid metabolism in the cell.

Figs 18–6, 18–17, and 18–18). Here we focus on amino 
group transfer involving the amide nitrogen of glutamine.
 
More than a dozen known biosynthetic reactions use 
glutamine as the major physiological source of amino 
groups, and most of these occur in the pathways outlined 
in this chapter. As a class, the enzymes catalyzing these 
reactions are called glutamine amidotransferases. All 
have two structural domains: one binding glutamine, the 
other binding the second substrate, which serves as 
amino group acceptor (Fig. 22–10). A conserved Cys 
PII brings about a decrease in transcription of the same 
gene. This mechanism involves an interaction of PII 
with additional proteins involved in gene regulation, of 
a type described in Chapter 28. The net result of this 
elaborate system of controls is a decrease in glutamine 
synthetase activity when glutamine levels are high, and 
an increase in activity when glutamine levels are low 
and -ketoglutarate and ATP (substrates for the syn-
thetase reaction) are available. The multiple layers of 
regulation permit a sensitive response in which gluta-
mine synthesis is tailored to cellular needs.
Several Classes of Reactions Play Special Roles in the 
Biosynthesis of Amino Acids and Nucleotides
The pathways described in this chapter include a variety 
of interesting chemical rearrangements. Several of these 
recur and deserve special note before we progress to the 
pathways themselves. These are (1) transamination reac-
tions and other rearrangements promoted by enzymes 
containing pyridoxal phosphate; (2) transfer of one-car-
bon groups, with either tetrahydrofolate (usually at the 
—CHO and —CH2OH oxidation levels) or S-adenosylme-
thionine (at the —CH3 oxidation level) as cofactor; and 
(3) transfer of amino groups derived from the amide 
nitrogen of glutamine. Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP), tetra-
hydrofolate (H4 folate), and S-adenosylmethionine 
(adoMet) are described in some detail in Chapter 18 (see

MECHANISM FIGURE 22–10 Proposed mechanism for glutamine amido-

contains structural elements conserved among many of these enzymes, 
including a Cys residue required for activity. The NH3-acceptor (second-
substrate) domain varies. Two types of amino acceptors are shown. X rep-
resents an activating group, typically a phosphoryl group derived from ATP, 
that facilitates displacement of a hydroxyl group from R—OH by NH3.

22.2 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids

22.2 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids
All amino acids are derived from intermediates in gly-
colysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate 
pathway (Fig. 22–11). Nitrogen enters these pathways 
by way of glutamate and glutamine. Some pathways 
are simple, others are not. Ten of the amino acids are 
just one or several steps removed from the common 
metabolite from which they are derived. The biosyn-
thetic pathways for others, such as the aromatic 
amino acids, are more complex.
 
Organisms vary greatly in their ability to synthe-
size the 20 common amino acids. Whereas most bacte-
ria and plants can synthesize all 20, mammals can 
synthesize only about half of them—generally those 
residue in the glutamine-binding domain is believed to act 
as a nucleophile, cleaving the amide bond of glutamine 
and forming a covalent glutamyl-enzyme intermediate. 
The NH3 produced in this reaction is not released, but 
instead is transferred through an “ammonia channel” to a 
second active site, where it reacts with the second sub-
strate to form the aminated product. The covalent inter-
mediate is hydrolyzed to the free enzyme and glutamate. 
If the second substrate must be activated, the usual 
method is the use of ATP to generate an acyl phosphate 
intermediate (R—OX in Fig. 22–10, with X as a phospho-
ryl group). The enzyme glutaminase acts in a similar 
fashion but uses H2O as the second substrate, yielding 
NH
4 and glutamate (see Fig. 18–8).
SUMMARY 22.1 Overview of Nitrogen Metabolism
 The molecular nitrogen that makes up 80% of 
Earth’s atmosphere is unavailable to most living 
organisms until it is reduced. This fixation of 
atmospheric N2 takes place in certain free-living 
bacteria and in symbiotic bacteria in the root 
nodules of leguminous plants.
 In soil bacteria and vascular plants, the sequential 
action of nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase 
converts NO3
 to NH3, which can be assimilated 
into nitrogen-containing compounds.
 The nitrogen cycle entails formation of ammonia by 
bacterial fixation of N2, nitrification of ammonia to 
nitrate by soil organisms, conversion of nitrate to 
ammonia by higher plants, synthesis of amino acids 
from ammonia by all organisms, and conversion of 
nitrate to N2 by denitrifying soil bacteria. The 
anammox bacteria anaerobically oxidize ammonia 
to nitrogen, using nitrite as an electron acceptor.
 Fixation of N2 as NH3 is carried out by the 
nitrogenase complex, in a reaction that requires 
large investments of ATP and of reducing power. The 
nitrogenase complex is highly labile in the presence of 
O2, and is subject to regulation by the supply of NH3.
 In living systems, reduced nitrogen is incorporated 
first into amino acids and then into a variety of 
other biomolecules, including nucleotides. The key 
entry point is the amino acid glutamate. Glutamate 
and glutamine are the nitrogen donors in a wide 
range of biosynthetic reactions. Glutamine 
synthetase, which catalyzes the formation of 
glutamine from glutamate, is a main regulatory 
enzyme of nitrogen metabolism.
 The amino acid and nucleotide biosynthetic 
pathways make repeated use of the biological 
cofactors pyridoxal phosphate, tetrahydrofolate, and 
S-adenosylmethionine. Pyridoxal phosphate is 
required for transamination reactions involving 
glutamate and for other amino acid transformations. 
One-carbon transfers require S-adenosylmethionine 
and tetrahydrofolate. Glutamine amidotransferases 
catalyze reactions that incorporate nitrogen derived 
from glutamine.

ton precursors derive from three sources: glycolysis (light red), the citric

that avoid the problem of the spontaneous cyclization of 
glutamate -semialdehyde (Fig. 22–12). In the first step, 
the -amino group of glutamate is blocked by an acetyla-
tion requiring acetyl-CoA; then, after the transamination 
step, the acetyl group is removed to yield ornithine.
 
The pathways to proline and arginine are somewhat 
different in mammals. Proline can be synthesized by the 
pathway shown in Figure 22–12, but it is also formed 
from arginine obtained from dietary or tissue protein. 
Arginase, a urea cycle enzyme, converts arginine to orni-
thine and urea (see Figs 18–10, 18–26). The ornithine is 
converted to glutamate -semialdehyde by the enzyme 
ornithine -aminotransferase (Fig. 22–13). The 
semialdehyde cyclizes to 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, 
which is then converted to proline (Fig. 22–12). The 
pathway for arginine synthesis shown in Figure 22–12 is 
absent in mammals. When arginine from dietary intake 
or protein turnover is insufficient for protein synthesis, 
the ornithine -aminotransferase reaction operates in 
the direction of ornithine formation. Ornithine is then 
converted to citrulline and arginine in the urea cycle.

with simple pathways. These are the nonessential 
amino acids, not needed in the diet (see Table 18–1). 
The remainder, the essential amino acids, must be 
obtained from food. Unless otherwise indicated, the 
pathways for the 20 common amino acids presented 
below are those operative in bacteria.
 
A useful way to organize these biosynthetic pathways 
is to group them into six families corresponding to their 
metabolic precursors (Table 22–1), and we use this 
approach to structure the detailed descriptions that follow. 
In addition to these six precursors, there is a notable inter-
mediate in several pathways of amino acid and nucleotide 
synthesis: 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP):

We have already described the biosynthesis of gluta-
mate and glutamine. Proline is a cyclized derivative 
of glutamate (Fig. 22–12). In the first step of proline 
synthesis, ATP reacts with the -carboxyl group of glu-
tamate to form an acyl phosphate, which is reduced by 
NADPH or NADH to glutamate -semialdehyde. This 
intermediate undergoes rapid spontaneous cyclization 
and is then reduced further to yield proline.
 
Arginine is synthesized from glutamate via ornithine 
and the urea cycle in animals (Chapter 18). In principle, 
ornithine could also be synthesized from glutamate -semi-
aldehyde by transamination, but the spontaneous cyc-
lization of the semialdehyde in the proline pathway pre-
cludes a sufficient supply of this intermediate for ornithine 
synthesis. Bacteria have a de novo biosynthetic pathway 
for ornithine (and thus arginine) that parallels some steps 
of the proline pathway but includes two additional steps

FIGURE 22–12 Biosynthesis of proline and arginine from glutamate in bac-
teria. All five carbon atoms of proline arise from glutamate. In many organ-
isms, glutamate dehydrogenase is unusual in that it uses either NADH or 
NADPH as a cofactor. The same may be true of other enzymes in these path-
ways. The -semialdehyde in the proline pathway undergoes a rapid, revers-
ible cyclization to D1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), with the equilibrium 
favoring P5C formation. Cyclization is averted in the ornithine/arginine path-
way by acetylation of the -amino group of glutamate in the first step and 
removal of the acetyl group after the transamination. Although some bacteria 
lack arginase and thus the complete urea cycle, they can synthesize arginine 
from ornithine in steps that parallel the mammalian urea cycle, with citrulline 
and argininosuccinate as intermediates (see Fig. 18–10).
 
Here, and in subsequent figures in this chapter, the reaction arrows indi-
cate the linear path to the final products, without considering the reversibility 
of individual steps. For example, the step of the pathway leading to arginine 
that is catalyzed by N-acetylglutamate dehydrogenase is chemically similar 
to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase reaction in glycolysis 
(see Fig. 14–8), and is readily reversible.

The major pathway for the formation of serine is the 
same in all organisms (Fig. 22–14). In the first step, the 
hydroxyl group of 3-phosphoglycerate is oxidized by a 
dehydrogenase (using NAD) to yield 3-phosphohy-
droxypyruvate. Transamination from glutamate yields 
3-phosphoserine, which is hydrolyzed to free serine by 
phosphoserine phosphatase.

reaction: a step in the mammalian pathway 
to proline. This enzyme is found in the mito-
chondrial matrix of most tissues. Although the 
equilibrium favors P5C formation, the reverse 
reaction is the only mammalian pathway for 
synthesis of ornithine (and thus arginine) 
when arginine levels are insufficient for protein 
synthesis.
 
Serine (three carbons) is the precursor of glycine 
(two carbons) through removal of a carbon atom by 
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (Fig. 22–14). Tet-
rahydrofolate accepts the  carbon (C-3) of serine, 
which forms a methylene bridge between N-5 and 
N-10 to yield N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (see 
Fig. 18–17). The overall reaction, which is reversible, 
also requires pyridoxal phosphate. In the liver of verte-
brates, glycine can be made by another route: the 
reverse of the reaction shown in Figure 18–20c, cata-
lyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage 
enzyme):

Plants and bacteria produce the reduced sulfur 
required for the synthesis of cysteine (and methio-
nine, described later) from environmental sulfates; the 
pathway is shown on the right side of Figure 22–15. 
Sulfate is activated in two steps to produce 39-phospho-
adenosine 59-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which undergoes 
an eight-electron reduction to sulfide. The sulfide is 
then used in the formation of cysteine from serine in a 
two-step pathway. Mammals synthesize cysteine from 
two amino acids: methionine furnishes the sulfur atom, 
and serine furnishes the carbon skeleton. Methionine is 
first converted to S-adenosylmethionine (see Fig. 
18–18), which can lose its methyl group to any of a 
number of acceptors to form S-adenosylhomocysteine 
(adoHcy). This demethylated product is hydrolyzed to 
free homocysteine, which undergoes a reaction with 
serine, catalyzed by cystathionine -synthase, to 
yield cystathionine (Fig. 22–16). Finally, cystathio-
nine -lyase, a PLP-requiring enzyme, catalyzes 
removal of ammonia and cleavage of cystathionine to 
yield free cysteine.

Aspartate gives rise to methionine, threonine, 
and lysine. Branch points occur at aspartate -semial-
dehyde, an intermediate in all three pathways, and at 
homoserine, a precursor of threonine and methionine. 
Threonine, in turn, is one of the precursors of isoleu-
cine. The valine and isoleucine pathways share four 
enzymes (Fig. 22–17, steps 18 to 21 ). Pyruvate gives 
rise to valine and isoleucine in pathways that begin with 
condensation of two carbons of pyruvate (in the form of 
hydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate; see Fig. 14–15) 
with another molecule of pyruvate (the valine path) 
or with -ketobutyrate (the isoleucine path). The 
-ketobutyrate is derived from threonine in a reaction 
that requires pyridoxal phosphate (Fig. 22–17, step 17 ). An 
intermediate in the valine pathway, -ketoisovalerate, is 
the starting point for a four-step branch pathway lead-
ing to leucine (steps 22 to 25).

Aromatic rings are not readily available in the environ-
ment, even though the benzene ring is very stable. The 
branched pathway to tryptophan, phenylalanine, and 
tyrosine, occurring in bacteria, fungi, and plants, is the 
main biological route of aromatic ring formation. It pro-
ceeds through ring closure of an aliphatic precursor 
followed by stepwise addition of double bonds. The first 
four steps produce shikimate, a seven-carbon molecule 
derived from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenol-
pyruvate (Fig. 22–18). Shikimate is converted to cho-
rismate in three steps that include the addition of three 
more carbons from another molecule of phosphoenol-
pyruvate. Chorismate is the first branch point of the 
pathway, with one branch leading to tryptophan, the 
other to phenylalanine and tyrosine.
 
In the tryptophan branch (Fig. 22–19), choris-
mate is converted to anthranilate in a reaction in which 
glutamine donates the nitrogen that will become part of 
the indole ring. Anthranilate then condenses with 
PRPP. The indole ring of tryptophan is derived from the 
ring carbons and amino group of anthranilate plus two 
carbons derived from PRPP. The final reaction in the 
sequence is catalyzed by tryptophan synthase. This 
enzyme has an 22 subunit structure and can be dis-
sociated into two  subunits and a 2 unit that catalyze 
different parts of the overall reaction:
Indole-3-glycerol phosphate 
 
 
 subunit
indole  glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
Indole  serine 
 tryptophan  H2O
 
2 subunit
The second part of the reaction requires pyridoxal 
phosphate (Fig. 22–20). Indole formed in the first part 
is not released by the enzyme, but instead moves 
through a channel from the -subunit active site to one 
of the -subunit active sites, where it condenses with a 
Schiff base intermediate derived from serine and PLP. 
Intermediate channeling of this type may be a feature of 
the entire pathway from chorismate to tryptophan. 
Enzyme active sites catalyzing different steps (some-
times not sequential steps) of the pathway to trypto-
phan are found on single polypeptides in some species 
of fungi and bacteria, but are separate proteins in other 
species. In addition, the activity of some of these 
enzymes requires a noncovalent association with other 
enzymes of the pathway. These observations suggest 
that all the pathway enzymes are components of a large, 
multienzyme complex in both bacteria and eukaryotes. 
Such complexes are generally not preserved intact 
when the enzymes are isolated using traditional bio-
chemical methods, but evidence for the existence of 
multienzyme complexes is accumulating for this and 
other metabolic pathways (see Section 16.3).
 
In plants and bacteria, phenylalanine and tyro-
sine are synthesized from chorismate in pathways 
much less complex than the tryptophan pathway. The 
common intermediate is prephenate (Fig. 22–21). 
The final step in both cases is transamination with 
glutamate.
 
Animals can produce tyrosine directly from phenyl-
alanine through hydroxylation at C-4 of the phenyl 
group by phenylalanine hydroxylase; this enzyme 
also participates in the degradation of phenylalanine 
(see Figs 18–23, 18–24). Tyrosine is considered a con-
ditionally essential amino acid, or as nonessential inso-
far as it can be synthesized from the essential amino 
acid phenylalanine.
Histidine Biosynthesis Uses Precursors 
of Purine Biosynthesis
Ribose 5-phosphate
Histidine
The pathway to histidine in all plants and bacteria dif-
fers in several respects from other amino acid biosyn-
thetic pathways. Histidine is derived from three precur-
sors (Fig. 22–22): PRPP contributes five carbons, the 
purine ring of ATP contributes a nitrogen and a carbon, 
and glutamine supplies the second ring nitrogen. The 
key steps are condensation of ATP and PRPP, in which

FIGURE 22–18 Biosynthesis of chorismate, an intermedi-
ate in the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in bacteria 
and plants. All carbons are derived from either erythrose 
4-phosphate (light purple) or phosphoenolpyruvate (light 
red). Note that the NAD required as a cofactor in step 2 
is released unchanged; it may be transiently reduced to 
NADH during the reaction, with formation of an oxidized 
reaction intermediate. Step 6 is competitively inhibited by 
glyphosate ( 2COOOCH2ONHOCH2OPO22
3 ), the active 
ingredient in the widely used herbicide Roundup. The herbi-
cide is relatively nontoxic to mammals, which lack this bio-
synthetic pathway. The chemical names quinate, shikimate, 
and chorismate are derived from the names of plants in 
which these intermediates have been found to accumulate.
N-1 of the purine ring is linked to the activated C-1 of 
the ribose of PRPP (step 1 in Fig. 22–22); purine ring 
opening that ultimately leaves N-1 and C-2 of adenine 
linked to the ribose (step 3); and formation of the 
imidazole ring, a reaction in which glutamine donates a 
nitrogen (step 5). The use of ATP as a metabolite 
rather than a high-energy cofactor is unusual—but not 
wasteful, because it dovetails with the purine biosyn-
thetic pathway. The remnant of ATP that is released 
after the transfer of N-1 and C-2 is 5-aminoimidazole-4-
carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an intermediate 
of purine biosynthesis (see Fig. 22–35) that is rapidly 
recycled to ATP.
Amino Acid Biosynthesis Is under Allosteric 
Regulation
As detailed in Chapter 15, the control of flux through a 
metabolic pathway often reflects the activity of multiple 
enzymes in that pathway. In the case of amino acid syn-
thesis, regulation takes place in part through feedback 
inhibition of the first reaction by the end product of the 
pathway. This first reaction is often catalyzed by an allo-
steric enzyme that plays an important role in the overall 
control of flux through that pathway. As an example, 
Figure 22–23 shows the allosteric regulation of isoleu-
cine synthesis from threonine (detailed in Fig. 22–17).

FIGURE 22–19 Biosynthesis of tryp-
tophan from chorismate in bacteria 
and plants. In E. coli, enzymes cata-
lyzing steps 1 and 2 are subunits of 
a single complex.
The end product, isoleucine, is an allosteric inhibitor of 
the first reaction in the sequence. In bacteria, such allo-
steric modulation of amino acid synthesis contributes to 
the minute-to-minute adjustment of pathway activity to 
cellular needs.
 
Allosteric regulation of an individual enzyme can be 
considerably more complex. An example is the remark-
able set of allosteric controls exerted on glutamine 
synthetase of E. coli (Fig. 22–8). Six products derived 
from glutamine serve as negative feedback modulators 
of the enzyme, and the overall effects of these and other 
modulators are more than additive. Such regulation is 
called concerted inhibition.
 
Additional mechanisms contribute to the regulation 
of the amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Because the 20 
common amino acids must be made in the correct pro-
portions for protein synthesis, cells have developed ways 
not only of controlling the rate of synthesis of individual 
amino acids but also of coordinating their formation. 
Such coordination is especially well developed in fast-
growing bacterial cells. Figure 22–24 shows how E. coli 
cells coordinate the synthesis of lysine, methionine, 
threonine, and isoleucine, all made from aspartate. Sev-
eral important types of inhibition patterns are evident. 
The step from aspartate to aspartyl--phosphate is cata-
lyzed by three isozymes, each independently controlled 
by different modulators. This enzyme multiplicity pre-
vents one biosynthetic end product from shutting down 
key steps in a pathway when other products of the same 
pathway are required. The steps from aspartate -semial-
dehyde to homoserine and from threonine to -ketobu-
tyrate (detailed in Fig. 22–17) are also catalyzed by dual, 
independently controlled isozymes. One isozyme for the 
conversion of aspartate to aspartyl--phosphate is allo-
sterically inhibited by two different modulators, lysine 
and isoleucine, whose action is more than additive—
another example of concerted inhibition. The sequence 
from aspartate to isoleucine undergoes multiple, overlap-
ping negative feedback inhibitions; for example, isoleucine 
inhibits the conversion of threonine to -ketobutyrate 
(as described above), and threonine inhibits its own for-
mation at three points: from homoserine, from aspartate 
-semialdehyde, and from aspartate (steps 4, 3, and 1 
in Fig. 22–17). This overall regulatory mechanism is 
called sequential feedback inhibition.
 
Similar patterns are evident in the pathways lead-
ing to the aromatic amino acids. The first step of the

early pathway to the common intermediate chorismate 
is catalyzed by the enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabino-
heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (1 in 
Fig. 22–18). Most microorganisms and plants have 
three DAHP synthase isozymes. One is allosterically 
inhibited (feedback inhibition) by phenylalanine, 
another by tyrosine, and the third by tryptophan. This 
scheme helps the overall pathway to respond to cellu-
lar requirements for one or more of the aromatic amino 
acids. Additional regulation takes place after the path-
way branches at chorismate. For example, the enzymes 
catalyzing the first two steps of the tryptophan branch 
are subject to allosteric inhibition by tryptophan.
SUMMARY 22.2 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids
 Plants and bacteria synthesize all 20 common 
amino acids. Mammals can synthesize about half; 
the others are required in the diet (essential amino 
acids).
 Among the nonessential amino acids, glutamate is 
formed by reductive amination of -ketoglutarate 
and serves as the precursor of glutamine, proline, 
and arginine. Alanine and aspartate (and thus 
asparagine) are formed from pyruvate and 
oxaloacetate, respectively, by transamination. The 
carbon chain of serine is derived from 
3-phosphoglycerate. Serine is a precursor of 
glycine; the -carbon atom of serine is transferred 
to tetrahydrofolate. In microorganisms, cysteine is 
produced from serine and from sulfide produced 
by the reduction of environmental sulfate. 
Mammals produce cysteine from methionine and 
serine by a series of reactions requiring 
S-adenosylmethionine and cystathionine.
 Among the essential amino acids, the aromatic 
amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and 
tryptophan) form by a pathway in which 
chorismate occupies a key branch point. 
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is a precursor of 
tryptophan and histidine. The pathway to 
histidine is interconnected with the purine 
synthetic pathway. Tyrosine can also be formed 
by hydroxylation of phenylalanine (and thus is 
considered conditionally essential). The 
pathways for the other essential amino acids are 
complex.
 The amino acid biosynthetic pathways are subject 
to allosteric end-product inhibition; the regulatory 
enzyme is usually the first in the sequence. 
Regulation of the various synthetic pathways is 
coordinated.
22.3 Molecules Derived from Amino Acids
In addition to their role as the building blocks of pro-
teins, amino acids are precursors of many specialized 
biomolecules, including hormones, coenzymes, nucleo-
tides, alkaloids, cell wall polymers, porphyrins, antibi-
otics, pigments, and neurotransmitters. We describe 
here the pathways to a number of these amino acid 
derivatives.
Glycine Is a Precursor of Porphyrins
The biosynthesis of porphyrins, for which glycine is a 
major precursor, is our first example because of the cen-
tral importance of the porphyrin nucleus in heme pro-
teins such as hemoglobin and the cytochromes. The 
porphyrins are constructed from four molecules of the 
monopyrrole derivative porphobilinogen, which itself is 
derived from two molecules of -aminolevulinate. There 
are two major pathways to -aminolevulinate. In higher 
eukaryotes (Fig. 22–25a), glycine reacts with succinyl-
CoA in the first step to yield -amino--ketoadipate,

FIGURE 22–24 Interlocking regulatory mechanisms in the biosynthesis 
of several amino acids derived from aspartate in E. coli. Three enzymes 
(A, B, C) have either two or three isozyme forms, indicated by numerical 
subscripts. In each case, one isozyme (A2, B1, and C2) has no allosteric 
regulation; these isozymes are regulated by changes in the amount of 
enzyme synthesized (Chapter 28). Synthesis of isozymes A2 and B1 is 
repressed when methionine levels are high, and synthesis of isozyme C2
is repressed when isoleucine levels are high. Enzyme A is aspartokinase; 
B, homoserine dehydrogenase; C, threonine dehydratase.
which is then decarboxylated to -aminolevulinate. In 
plants, algae, and most bacteria, -aminolevulinate is 
formed from glutamate (Fig. 22–25b). The glutamate is 
first esterified to glutamyl-tRNAGlu (see Chapter 27 on 
the topic of transfer RNAs); reduction by NADPH con-
verts the glutamate to glutamate 1-semialdehyde, which 
is cleaved from the tRNA. An aminotransferase converts 
the glutamate 1-semialdehyde to -aminolevulinate.
 
In all organisms, two molecules of -aminolevu-
linate condense to form porphobilinogen and, through 
a series of complex enzymatic reactions, four molecules 
of porphobilinogen come together to form protopor-
phyrin (Fig. 22–26). The iron atom is incorporated 
after the protoporphyrin has been assembled, in a step 
catalyzed by ferrochelatase. Porphyrin biosynthesis is 
regulated in higher eukaryotes by heme, which serves 
as a feedback inhibitor of early steps in the synthetic 
pathway. Genetic defects in the biosynthesis of porphy-
rins can lead to the accumulation of pathway interme-
diates, causing a variety of human diseases known 
collectively as porphyrias (Box 22–2).
Heme Is the Source of Bile Pigments
 
 
The iron-porphyrin (heme) group of hemoglo-
bin, released from dying erythrocytes in the 
spleen, is degraded to yield free Fe2 and, ultimately, 
bilirubin. This pathway is arresting for its capacity to 
inject color into human biochemistry.
 
The first step in the two-step pathway, catalyzed by 
heme oxygenase, converts heme to biliverdin, a linear 
(open) tetrapyrrole derivative (Fig. 22–27). The other 
products of the reaction are free Fe2 and CO. The Fe2 
is quickly bound by ferritin. Carbon monoxide is a poi-
son that binds to hemoglobin (see Box 5–1), and the 
production of CO by heme oxygenase ensures that, 
even in the absence of environmental exposure, about 
1% of an individual’s heme is complexed with CO.
 
Biliverdin is converted to bilirubin in the second 
step, catalyzed by biliverdin reductase. You can monitor 
this reaction colorimetrically in a familiar in situ experi-
ment. When you are bruised, the black and/or purple 
color results from hemoglobin released from damaged 
erythrocytes. Over time, the color changes to the green 
of biliverdin, and then to the yellow of bilirubin. Biliru-
bin is largely insoluble, and it travels in the bloodstream 
as a complex with serum albumin. In the liver, bilirubin is 
transformed to the bile pigment bilirubin diglucuronide. 
This product is sufficiently water-soluble to be secreted 
with other components of bile into the small intestine, 
where microbial enzymes convert it to several products, 
predominantly urobilinogen. Some urobilinogen is reab-
sorbed into the blood and transported to the kidney, 
where it is converted to urobilin, the compound that gives 
urine its yellow color (Fig. 22–27). Urobilinogen remain-
ing in the intestine is converted (in another microbe-
dependent reaction) to stercobilin (Fig. 22–27), which 
imparts the red-brown color to feces.

Impaired liver function or blocked bile secretion 
causes bilirubin to leak from the liver into the blood, 
resulting in a yellowing of the skin and eyeballs, a condi-
tion called jaundice. In cases of jaundice, determination 
of the concentration of bilirubin in the blood may be use-
ful in the diagnosis of underlying liver disease. Newborn 
infants sometimes develop jaundice because they have 
not yet produced enough glucuronyl bilirubin transfer-
ase to process their bilirubin. A traditional treatment to 
reduce excess bilirubin, exposure to a fluorescent lamp, 
causes a photochemical conversion of bilirubin to com-
pounds that are more soluble and easily excreted.
 
These pathways of heme breakdown play signifi-
cant roles in protecting cells from oxidative damage and 
in regulating certain cellular functions. The CO pro-
duced by heme oxygenase is toxic at high concentra-
tions, but at the very low concentrations generated 
during heme degradation it seems to have some regula-
tory and/or signaling functions. It acts as a vasodilator, 
much the same as (but less potent than) nitric oxide 
(discussed below). Low levels of CO also have some 
regulatory effects on neurotransmission. Bilirubin is the 
most abundant antioxidant in mammalian tissues and is 
responsible for most of the antioxidant activity in 
serum. Its protective effects seem to be especially 
important in the developing brain of newborn infants. 
The cell toxicity associated with jaundice may be due to 
bilirubin levels in excess of the serum albumin needed 
to solubilize it.
 
Given these varied roles of heme degradation prod-
ucts, the degradative pathway is subject to regulation, 
mainly at the first step. Humans have at least three iso-
zymes of heme oxygenase (HO). HO-1 is highly regu-
lated; the expression of its gene is induced by a wide 
range of stress conditions (shear stress, angiogenesis 
(uncontrolled development of blood vessels), hypoxia, 
hyperoxia, heat shock, exposure to ultraviolet light, 
hydrogen peroxide, and many other metabolic insults). 
HO-2 is found mainly in brain and testes, where it is 
continuously expressed. The third isozyme, HO-3, is not 
yet well characterized. ■
Amino Acids Are Precursors of Creatine 
and Glutathione
Phosphocreatine, derived from creatine, is an impor-
tant energy buffer in skeletal muscle (see Box 23–2). 
Creatine is synthesized from glycine and arginine (Fig. 
22–28); methionine, in the form of S-adenosylmethio-
nine, acts as methyl group donor.
 
Glutathione (GSH), present in plants, animals, 
and some bacteria, often at high levels, can be thought 
Porphyrias are a group of genetic diseases that result 
from defects in enzymes of the biosynthetic pathway 
from glycine to porphyrins; specific porphyrin precur-
sors accumulate in erythrocytes, body fluids, and the 
liver. The most common form is acute intermittent 
porphyria. Most individuals inheriting this condition 
are heterozygotes and are usually asymptomatic, 
because the single copy of the normal gene provides 
a sufficient level of enzyme function. However, certain 
nutritional or environmental factors (as yet poorly 
understood) can cause a buildup of -aminolevulinate 
and porphobilinogen, leading to attacks of acute 
abdominal pain and neurological dysfunction. King 
George III, British monarch during the American 
Revolution, suffered several episodes of apparent 
madness that tarnished the record of this otherwise 
accomplished man. The symptoms of his condition 
suggest that George III suffered from acute intermit-
tent porphyria.
One of the rarer porphyrias results in an accumu-
lation of uroporphyrinogen I, an abnormal isomer of a 
protoporphyrin precursor. This compound stains the 
urine red, causes the teeth to fluoresce strongly in 
ultraviolet light, and makes the skin abnormally sensi-
tive to sunlight. Many individuals with this porphyria 
are anemic because insufficient heme is synthesized. 
This genetic condition may have given rise to the 
vampire myths of folk legend.
 
The symptoms of most porphyrias are now readily 
controlled with dietary changes or the administration 
of heme or heme derivatives.

of as a redox buffer. It is derived from glutamate, cysteine, 
and glycine (Fig. 22–29). The -carboxyl group of glu-
tamate is activated by ATP to form an acyl phosphate 
intermediate, which is then attacked by the -amino 
group of cysteine. A second condensation reaction fol-
lows, with the -carboxyl group of cysteine activated to 
an acyl phosphate to permit reaction with glycine. The 
oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG), produced in the 
course of its redox activities, contains two glutathione 
molecules linked by a disulfide bond.
 
Glutathione probably helps maintain the sulfhydryl 
groups of proteins in the reduced state and the iron of 
heme in the ferrous (Fe2) state, and it serves as a 
reducing agent for glutaredoxin in deoxyribonucleotide 
synthesis (see Fig. 22–41). Its redox function is also used 
to remove toxic peroxides formed in the normal course of 
growth and metabolism under aerobic conditions:
2 GSH 1 R—O—O—H ¡ GSSG 1 H2O 1 R—OH
This reaction is catalyzed by glutathione peroxidase, 
a remarkable enzyme in that it contains a covalently 
bound selenium (Se) atom in the form of selenocysteine 
(see Fig. 3–8a), which is essential for its activity.
D-Amino Acids Are Found Primarily in Bacteria
 
 
Although D-amino acids do not generally occur in 
proteins, they do serve some special functions in 
the structure of bacterial cell walls and peptide antibiot-
ics. Bacterial peptidoglycans (see Fig. 20–30) contain 
both D-alanine and D-glutamate. D-Amino acids arise 
directly from the L isomers by the action of amino acid 
racemases, which have pyridoxal phosphate as cofactor 
(see Fig. 18–6). Amino acid racemization is uniquely 
important to bacterial metabolism, and enzymes such as 
alanine racemase are prime targets for pharmaceutical 
agents. One such agent, L-fluoroalanine, is being tested 
as an antibacterial drug. Another, cycloserine, is used 
to treat tuberculosis. Because these inhibitors also 
affect some PLP-requiring human enzymes, however, 
they have potentially undesirable side effects. ■

Phenylalanine and tyrosine also give rise to many 
commercially significant natural products, including 
the tannins that inhibit oxidation in wines; alkaloids 
such as morphine, which have potent physiological 
effects; and the flavoring of cinnamon oil (Fig. 22–30b), 
nutmeg, cloves, vanilla, cayenne pepper, and other 
products.

Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are converted 
to a variety of important compounds in plants. The 
rigid polymer lignin, derived from phenylalanine and 
tyrosine, is second only to cellulose in abundance in 
plant tissues. The structure of the lignin polymer is 
complex and not well understood. Tryptophan is also

acetate, or auxin (Fig. 22–30a), which is important

22.3 Molecules Derived from Amino Acids 
909
form complexes with DNA are derived from the amino 
acid ornithine, a component of the urea cycle. A com-
mon denominator of many of these pathways is amino 
acid decarboxylation, another PLP-requiring reaction 
(see Fig. 18–6).
 
The synthesis of some neurotransmitters is illus-
trated in Figure 22–31. Tyrosine gives rise to a family 
of catecholamines that includes dopamine, norepi-
nephrine, and epinephrine. Levels of catecholamines 
are correlated with, among other things, changes in 
blood pressure. The neurological disorder Parkinson 
disease is associated with an underproduction of dopa-
mine, and it has traditionally been treated by adminis-
tering L-dopa. Overproduction of dopamine in the brain 
may be linked to psychological disorders such as 
schizophrenia.
 
Glutamate decarboxylation gives rise to -amino-
butyrate (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Its 
underproduction is associated with epileptic seizures. 
GABA analogs are used in the treatment of epilepsy and 
hypertension. Levels of GABA can also be increased by 
administering inhibitors of the GABA-degrading enzyme 
GABA aminotransferase. Another important neurotrans-
mitter, serotonin, is derived from tryptophan in a two-
step pathway.
 
Histidine undergoes decarboxylation to histamine, 
a powerful vasodilator in animal tissues. Histamine is 
released in large amounts as part of the allergic response, 
and it also stimulates acid secretion in the stomach. A 
growing array of pharmaceutical agents are being 
designed to interfere with either the synthesis or the 
action of histamine. A prominent example is the hista-
mine receptor antagonist cimetidine (Tagamet), a 
structural analog of histamine:

It promotes the healing of duodenal ulcers by inhibiting 
secretion of gastric acid.
 
Polyamines such as spermine and spermidine, 
involved in DNA packaging, are derived from methio-
nine and ornithine by the pathway shown in Figure 
22–32. The first step is decarboxylation of ornithine, a 
precursor of arginine (Fig. 22–12). Ornithine decar-
boxylase, a PLP-requiring enzyme, is the target of 
several powerful inhibitors used as pharmaceutical 
agents (see Box 6–3). ■
Arginine Is the Precursor for Biological Synthesis 
of Nitric Oxide
A surprise finding in the mid-1980s was the role of nitric 
oxide (NO)—previously known mainly as a component 
of smog—as an important biological messenger. This 
simple gaseous substance diffuses readily through 
membranes, although its high reactivity limits its range 
of diffusion to about a 1 mm radius from the site of syn-
thesis. In humans NO plays a role in a range of physio-
logical processes, including neurotransmission, blood 
clotting, and the control of blood pressure. Its mode of 
action is described in Chapter 12 (see Section 12.4).
 
Nitric oxide is synthesized from arginine in an 
NADPH-dependent reaction catalyzed by nitric oxide 
synthase (Fig. 22–33), a dimeric enzyme structurally 
related to NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (see 
Box 21–1). The reaction is a five-electron oxidation. 
Each subunit of the enzyme contains one bound mole-
cule of each of four different cofactors: FMN, FAD, tet-
rahydrobiopterin, and Fe3 heme. NO is an unstable 
molecule and cannot be stored. Its synthesis is stimu-
lated by interaction of nitric oxide synthase with Ca2-
calmodulin (see Fig. 12–11).
SUMMARY 22.3 Molecules Derived from Amino Acids

amino acids. Glycine is a precursor of porphyrins. 
Degradation of iron-porphyrin (heme) generates

several physiological functions.

22.4 Biosynthesis and Degradation 
of Nucleotides
As discussed in Chapter 8, nucleotides have a variety of 
important functions in all cells. They are the precursors 
of DNA and RNA. They are essential carriers of chemical 
energy—a role primarily of ATP and to some extent 
GTP. They are components of the cofactors NAD, 
FAD, S-adenosylmethionine, and coenzyme A, as well 
as of activated biosynthetic intermediates such as 
UDP-glucose and CDP-diacylglycerol. Some, such as 
cAMP and cGMP, are also cellular second messengers.
 
Two types of pathways lead to nucleotides: the de 
novo pathways and the salvage pathways. De novo 
 Glycine and arginine give rise to creatine and 
phosphocreatine, an energy buffer. Glutathione, 
formed from three amino acids, is an important 
cellular reducing agent.
 Bacteria synthesize D-amino acids from L-amino 
acids in racemization reactions requiring pyridoxal 
phosphate. D-Amino acids are commonly found in 
certain bacterial walls and certain antibiotics.
 The aromatic amino acids give rise to many plant 
substances. The PLP-dependent decarboxylation 
of some amino acids yields important biological 
amines, including neurotransmitters.

22.4 Biosynthesis and Degradation of Nucleotides

pyrimidine ring is synthesized as orotate, attached to 
ribose phosphate, and then converted to the common 
pyrimidine nucleotides required in nucleic acid synthe-
sis. Although the free bases are not intermediates in the 
de novo pathways, they are intermediates in some of the 
salvage pathways.
 
Several important precursors are shared by the de 
novo pathways for synthesis of pyrimidines and purines. 
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) is important in 
both, and in these pathways the structure of ribose is 
retained in the product nucleotide, in contrast to its fate 
in the tryptophan and histidine biosynthetic pathways 
discussed earlier. An amino acid is an important precur-
sor in each type of pathway: glycine for purines and 
synthesis of nucleotides begins with their metabolic 
precursors: amino acids, ribose 5-phosphate, CO2, and 
NH3. Salvage pathways recycle the free bases and 
nucleosides released from nucleic acid breakdown. Both 
types of pathways are important in cellular metabolism 
and both are discussed in this section.
 
The de novo pathways for purine and pyrimidine 
biosynthesis seem to be nearly identical in all living 
organisms. Notably, the free bases guanine, adenine, 
thymine, cytidine, and uracil are not intermediates in 
these pathways; that is, the bases are not synthesized 
and then attached to ribose, as might be expected. The 
purine ring structure is built up one or a few atoms at a 
time, attached to ribose throughout the process. The

formyltetrahydrofolate 3, and a nitrogen is contributed 
by glutamine (step 4), before dehydration and ring 
closure yield the five-membered imidazole ring of the 
purine nucleus, as 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide 
(AIR; step 5).
 
At this point, three of the six atoms needed for 
the second ring in the purine structure are in place. 
To complete the process, a carboxyl group is first 
added (step 6). This carboxylation is unusual in that 
it does not require biotin, but instead uses the bicar-
bonate generally present in aqueous solutions. A 
rearrangement transfers the carboxylate from the 
exocyclic amino group to position 4 of the imidazole 
ring (step 7). Steps 6 and 7 are found only in bac-
teria and fungi. In higher eukaryotes, including 
humans, the 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide prod-
uct of step 5 is carboxylated directly to carboxyami-
noimidazole ribonucleotide in one step instead of two 
(step 6a). The enzyme catalyzing this reaction is AIR 
carboxylase.
 
Aspartate now donates its amino group in two steps 
(8 and 9): formation of an amide bond, followed by 
elimination of the carbon skeleton of aspartate (as 
fumarate). (Recall that aspartate plays an analogous 
role in two steps of the urea cycle; see Fig. 18–10.) The 
final carbon is contributed by N10-formyltetrahydrofo-
late (step 10 ), and a second ring closure takes place to 
yield the second fused ring of the purine nucleus (step 
11 ). The first intermediate with a complete purine ring 
is inosinate (IMP).
 
As in the tryptophan and histidine biosynthetic 
pathways, the enzymes of IMP synthesis seem to be 
organized as large, multienzyme complexes in the cell. 
Once again, evidence comes from the existence of sin-
gle polypeptides with several functions, some catalyzing 
nonsequential steps in the pathway. In eukaryotic cells 
ranging from yeast to fruit flies to chickens, steps 1, 3, 
and 5 in Figure 22–35 are catalyzed by a multifunc-
tional protein. An additional multifunctional protein 
catalyzes steps 10  and 11 . In humans, a multifunctional 
enzyme combines the activities of AIR carboxylase 
and SAICAR synthetase (steps 6a and 8). In bacteria, 
aspartate for pyrimidines. Glutamine again is the most 
important source of amino groups—in five different 
steps in the de novo pathways. Aspartate is also used as 
the source of an amino group in the purine pathways, in 
two steps.
 
Two other features deserve mention. First, there is 
evidence, especially in the de novo purine pathway, that 
the enzymes are present as large, multienzyme complexes 
in the cell, a recurring theme in our discussion of metabo-
lism. Second, the cellular pools of nucleotides (other than 
ATP) are quite small, perhaps 1% or less of the amounts 
required to synthesize the cell’s DNA. Therefore, cells 
must continue to synthesize nucleotides during nucleic 
acid synthesis, and in some cases nucleotide synthesis 
may limit the rates of DNA replication and transcription. 
Because of the importance of these processes in dividing 
cells, agents that inhibit nucleotide synthesis have become 
particularly important in medicine.
 
We examine here the biosynthetic pathways of 
purine and pyrimidine nucleotides and their regulation, 
the formation of the deoxynucleotides, and the degra-
dation of purines and pyrimidines to uric acid and urea. 
We end with a discussion of chemotherapeutic agents 
that affect nucleotide synthesis.
De Novo Purine Nucleotide Synthesis 
Begins with PRPP
The two parent purine nucle-
otides of nucleic acids are 
adenosine 59-monophosphate 
(AMP; adenylate) and guano-
sine 
59-monophosphate 
(GMP; guanylate), containing 
the purine bases adenine and 
guanine. 
Figure 
22–34 
shows the origin of the car-
bon and nitrogen atoms of 
the purine ring system, as 
determined by John M. 
Buchanan 
using 
isotopic 
tracer experiments in birds. 
The detailed pathway of purine biosynthesis was worked 
out primarily by Buchanan and G. Robert Greenberg in 
the 1950s.
 
In the first committed step of the pathway, an 
amino group donated by glutamine is attached at C-1 of 
PRPP (Fig. 22–35). The resulting 5-phosphoribosyl-
amine is highly unstable, with a half-life of 30 seconds 
at pH 7.5. The purine ring is subsequently built up on 
this structure. The pathway described here is identical 
in all organisms, with the exception of one step that dif-
fers in higher eukaryotes, as noted below.
 
The second step is the addition of three atoms from 
glycine (Fig. 22–35, step 2). An ATP is consumed to 
activate the glycine carboxyl group (in the form of an 
acyl phosphate) for this condensation reaction. The 
added glycine amino group is then formylated by N10-

these activities are found on separate proteins, but 
the proteins may form a large noncovalent complex. 
The channeling of reaction intermediates from one 
enzyme to the next permitted by these complexes is 
probably especially important for unstable intermedi-
ates such as 5-phosphoribosylamine.
 
Conversion of inosinate to adenylate requires the 
insertion of an amino group derived from aspartate 
(Fig. 22–36); this takes place in two reactions similar 
to those used to introduce N-1 of the purine ring (Fig. 
22–35, steps 8 and 9). A crucial difference is that GTP 
rather than ATP is the source of the high-energy phos-
phate in synthesizing adenylosuccinate. Guanylate is 
formed by the NAD-requiring oxidation of inosinate at 
C-2, followed by addition of an amino group derived 
from glutamine. ATP is cleaved to AMP and PPi in the 
final step (Fig. 22–36).
Purine Nucleotide Biosynthesis Is Regulated 
by Feedback Inhibition
Three major feedback mechanisms cooperate in regulat-
ing the overall rate of de novo purine nucleotide synthe-
sis and the relative rates of formation of the two end 
products, adenylate and guanylate (Fig. 22–37). The 
first mechanism is exerted on the first reaction that is 
unique to purine synthesis: transfer of an amino group to 
PRPP to form 5-phosphoribosylamine. This reaction is 
catalyzed by the allosteric enzyme glutamine-PRPP ami-
dotransferase, which is inhibited by the end products 
IMP, AMP, and GMP. AMP and GMP act synergistically 
in this concerted inhibition. Thus, whenever either 
AMP or GMP accumulates to excess, the first step in its 
biosynthesis from PRPP is partially inhibited.
 
In the second control mechanism, exerted at a later 
stage, an excess of GMP in the cell inhibits formation of 
xanthylate from inosinate by IMP dehydrogenase, with-
out affecting the formation of AMP. Conversely, an 
accumulation of adenylate inhibits formation of adeny-
losuccinate by adenylosuccinate synthetase, without 
affecting the biosynthesis of GMP. When both products 
are present in sufficient quantities, IMP builds up, and 
it inhibits an earlier step in the pathway; this regulatory 
strategy is called sequential feedback inhibition. In 
the third mechanism, GTP is required in the conversion

of IMP to AMP, whereas ATP is required for conver-
sion of IMP to GMP (Fig. 22–36), a reciprocal arrange-
ment that tends to balance the synthesis of the two 
ribonucleotides.
 
The final control mechanism is the inhibition of 
PRPP synthesis by the allosteric regulation of ribose 
phosphate pyrophosphokinase. This enzyme is inhibited 
by ADP and GDP, in addition to metabolites from other 
pathways for which PRPP is a starting point.
Pyrimidine Nucleotides Are Made from Aspartate, 
PRPP, and Carbamoyl Phosphate
The common pyrimidine ribonucleotides are cytidine 
59-monophosphate (CMP; cytidylate) and uridine 
59-monophosphate (UMP; uridylate), which contain the 
pyrimidines cytosine and uracil. De novo pyrimidine 
nucleotide biosynthesis (Fig. 22–38) proceeds in a 
somewhat different manner from purine nucleotide syn-
thesis; the six-membered pyrimidine ring is made first 
and then attached to ribose 5-phosphate. Required in 
this process is carbamoyl phosphate, also an intermediate 
in the urea cycle. However, as we noted in Chapter 18, in 
animals the carbamoyl phosphate required in urea syn-
thesis is made in mitochondria by carbamoyl phosphate 
synthetase I, whereas the carbamoyl phosphate 
required in pyrimidine biosynthesis is made in the cyto-
sol by a different form of the enzyme, carbamoyl 
phosphate synthetase II. In bacteria, a single enzyme 
supplies carbamoyl phosphate for the synthesis of argi-
nine and pyrimidines. The bacterial enzyme has three 
separate active sites, spaced along a channel nearly 100 
Å long (Fig. 22–39). Bacterial carbamoyl phosphate 
synthetase provides a vivid illustration of the channel-
ing of unstable reaction intermediates between active 
sites.
 
Carbamoyl phosphate reacts with aspartate to yield 
N-carbamoylaspartate in the first committed step of 
pyrimidine biosynthesis (Fig. 22–38). This reaction is 
catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamoylase. In bacte-
ria, this step is highly regulated, and bacterial aspartate 
transcarbamoylase is one of the most thoroughly stud-
ied allosteric enzymes (see below). By removal of water 
from N-carbamoylaspartate, a reaction catalyzed by 
dihydroorotase, the pyrimidine ring is closed to form 
L-dihydroorotate. This compound is oxidized to the 
pyrimidine derivative orotate, a reaction in which NAD 
is the ultimate electron acceptor. In eukaryotes, the 
first three enzymes in this pathway—carbamoyl phos-
phate synthetase II, aspartate transcarbamoylase, and 
dihydroorotase—are part of a single trifunctional pro-
tein. The protein, known by the acronym CAD, contains 
three identical polypeptide chains (each of Mr 230,000), 
each with active sites for all three reactions. This sug-
gests that large, multienzyme complexes may be the 
rule in this pathway.
 
Once orotate is formed, the ribose 5-phosphate 
side chain, provided once again by PRPP, is attached to 
yield orotidylate (Fig. 22–38). Orotidylate is then

FIGURE 22–38 De novo synthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides: biosynthesis 
of UTP and CTP via orotidylate. The pyrimidine is constructed from car-
bamoyl phosphate and aspartate. The ribose 5-phosphate is then added 
to the completed pyrimidine ring by orotate phosphoribosyltransferase. 
The first step in this pathway (not shown here; see Fig. 18–11a) is the syn-
thesis of carbamoyl phosphate from CO2 and NH
4. In eukaryotes, the 
first step is catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II.

decarboxylated to uridylate, which is phosphorylated 
to UTP. CTP is formed from UTP by the action of cyti-
dylate synthetase, by way of an acyl phosphate inter-
mediate (consuming one ATP). The nitrogen donor is 
normally glutamine, although the cytidylate synthetas-
es in many species can use NH
4 directly.
Pyrimidine Nucleotide Biosynthesis Is Regulated 
by Feedback Inhibition
Regulation of the rate of pyrimidine nucleotide synthe-
sis in bacteria occurs in large part through aspartate 
transcarbamoylase (ATCase), which catalyzes the first 
reaction in the sequence and is inhibited by CTP, the 
end product of the sequence (Fig. 22–38). The bacterial 
ATCase molecule consists of six catalytic subunits and 
six regulatory subunits (see Fig. 6–33). The catalytic 
subunits bind the substrate molecules, and the alloste-
ric subunits bind the allosteric inhibitor, CTP. The 
entire ATCase molecule, as well as its subunits, exists in 
two conformations, active and inactive. When CTP is 
not bound to the regulatory subunits, the enzyme is 
maximally active. As CTP accumulates and binds to the 
regulatory subunits, they undergo a change in confor-
mation. This change is transmitted to the catalytic sub-
units, which then also shift to an inactive conformation. 
FIGURE 22–39 Channeling of intermediates in bacterial carbamoyl 
phosphate synthetase. (Derived from PDB ID 1M6V) The reaction cata-
lyzed by this enzyme (and its mitochondrial counterpart) is illustrated in 
Figure 18–11a. The small and large subunits are shown in tan and blue, re-
spectively; the tunnel between active sites (almost 100 Å long) is shown 
as white. In this reaction, a glutamine molecule binds to the small subunit, 
donating its amido nitrogen as NH
4 in a glutamine amidotransferase–type 
reaction. The NH
4 enters the tunnel, which takes it to a second active 
site, where it combines with bicarbonate in a reaction requiring ATP. The 
carbamate then reenters the tunnel to reach the third active site, where it 
is phosphorylated by ATP to carbamoyl phosphate. To solve this structure, 
the enzyme was crystallized with ornithine bound to the glutamine-binding 
site and ADP bound to the ATP-binding sites.

Nucleoside Monophosphates Are Converted 
to Nucleoside Triphosphates
Nucleotides to be used in biosynthesis are generally 
converted to nucleoside triphosphates. The conversion 
pathways are common to all cells. Phosphorylation of 
AMP to ADP is promoted by adenylate kinase, in the 
reaction
ATP 1 AMP ∆2 ADP
The ADP so formed is phosphorylated to ATP by the 
glycolytic enzymes or through oxidative phosphorylation.
 
ATP also brings about the formation of other nucle-
oside diphosphates by the action of a class of enzymes 
called nucleoside monophosphate kinases. These 
enzymes, which are generally specific for a particular 
base but nonspecific for the sugar (ribose or deoxyri-
bose), catalyze the reaction
ATP 1 NMP ∆ADP 1 NDP
The efficient cellular systems for rephosphorylating 
ADP to ATP tend to pull this reaction in the direction of 
products.
 
Nucleoside diphosphates are converted to triphos-
phates by the action of a ubiquitous enzyme, nucleo-
side diphosphate kinase, which catalyzes the reaction
NTPD 1 NDPA ∆NDPD 1 NTPA
This enzyme is notable in that it is not specific for the 
base (purines or pyrimidines) or the sugar (ribose or 
deoxyribose). This nonspecificity applies to both phos-
phate acceptor (A) and donor (D), although the donor 
(NTPD) is almost invariably ATP because it is present in 
higher concentration than other nucleoside triphos-
phates under aerobic conditions.
22.4 Biosynthesis and Degradation of Nucleotides 
917
 
Ribonucleotide reductase is notable in that its 
reaction mechanism provides the best-characterized 
example of the involvement of free radicals in bio-
chemical transformations, once thought to be rare in 
biological systems. The enzyme in E. coli and most 
eukaryotes is an 22 dimer, with catalytic subunits 2 
and radical-generation subunits 2 (Fig. 22–42). Each 
catalytic subunit contains two kinds of regulatory sites, 
Ribonucleotides Are the Precursors 
of Deoxyribonucleotides
Deoxyribonucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, are 
derived from the corresponding ribonucleotides by 
direct reduction at the 29-carbon atom of the D-ribose 
to form the 29-deoxy derivative. For example, adenos-
ine diphosphate (ADP) is reduced to 29-deoxyadenosine 
diphosphate (dADP), and GDP is reduced to dGDP. 
This reaction is somewhat unusual in that the reduc-
tion occurs at a nonactivated carbon; no closely analo-
gous chemical reactions are known. The reaction is 
catalyzed by ribonucleotide reductase, best charac-
terized in E. coli, in which its substrates are ribonucle-
oside diphosphates.
 
The reduction of the D-ribose portion of a ribonu-
cleoside diphosphate to 29-deoxy-D-ribose requires a 
pair of hydrogen atoms, which are ultimately donated 
by NADPH via an intermediate hydrogen-carrying pro-
tein, thioredoxin. This ubiquitous protein serves a 
similar redox function in photosynthesis (see Fig. 
20–19) and other processes. Thioredoxin has pairs of 
—SH groups that carry hydrogen atoms from NADPH 
to the ribonucleoside diphosphate. Its oxidized (disul-
fide) form is reduced by NADPH in a reaction catalyzed 
by thioredoxin reductase (Fig. 22–41), and reduced 
thioredoxin is then used by ribonucleotide reductase to 
reduce the nucleoside diphosphates (NDPs) to deoxy-
ribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDPs). A second source 
of reducing equivalents for ribonucleotide reductase is 
glutathione (GSH). Glutathione serves as the reductant 
for a protein closely related to thioredoxin, glutare-
doxin, which then transfers the reducing power to 
ribonucleotide reductase (Fig. 22–41).
FIGURE 22–41 Reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides by 
ribonucleotide reductase. Electrons are transmitted (red arrows) to the 
enzyme from NADPH via (a) glutaredoxin or (b) thioredoxin. The sul-
fide groups in glutaredoxin reductase are contributed by two molecules of 
bound glutathione (GSH; GSSG indicates oxidized glutathione). Note that 
thioredoxin reductase is a flavoenzyme, with FAD as prosthetic group.
FIGURE 22–42 Ribonucleotide reductase. (a) A schematic diagram 
of the subunit structures. The catalytic subunit (; also called R1) 
contains the two regulatory sites described in Fig. 22–44 and two Cys 
residues central to the reaction mechanism. The radical-generation 
subunits  (also called R2) contain the critical Tyr122 residue and the 
binuclear iron center. (b) Structures of 2 and 2 give the likely structure 
of 22 (derived from PDB ID 3UUS). (c) The likely path of radical 
formation from the initial Tyr122 in a  subunit to the active-site Cys439, 
which is used in the mechanism shown in Figure 22–43. Several aromatic 
amino acid residues participate in long-range radical transfer from the 
point of its formation at Tyr 1 22 to the active site, where the nucleotide 
substrate is bound.

enzyme (class I) requires oxygen to regenerate the tyro-
syl radical if it is quenched, so this enzyme functions only 
in an aerobic environment. Class II enzymes, found in 
other microorganisms, have 59-deoxyadenosylcobalamin 
(see Box 17–2) rather than a binuclear iron center. Class 
III enzymes have evolved to function in an anaerobic 
environment. E. coli contains a separate class III ribo-
nucleotide reductase when grown anaerobically; this 
enzyme contains an iron-sulfur cluster (structurally dis-
tinct from the binuclear iron center of the class I enzyme) 
and requires NADPH and S-adenosylmethionine for 
activity. It uses nucleoside triphosphates rather than 
nucleoside diphosphates as substrates. The evolution of 
different classes of ribonucleotide reductase for produc-
tion of DNA precursors in different environments reflects 
the importance of this reaction in nucleotide metabolism.
 
Regulation of E. coli ribonucleotide reductase is 
unusual in that not only its activity but its substrate 
specificity is regulated by the binding of effector mol-
ecules. Each  subunit has two types of regulatory 
as described below. The two active sites of the enzyme 
are formed at the interface between the catalytic (2) 
and radical-generation (2) subunits. At each active site, 
an  subunit contributes two sulfhydryl groups required 
for activity and the 2 subunits contribute a stable tyrosyl 
radical. The 2 subunits also have a binuclear iron (Fe3) 
cofactor that helps generate and stabilize the Tyr122 
radical (Fig. 22–42). The tyrosyl radical is too far from 
the active site to interact directly with the site, but sev-
eral aromatic residues form a long-range radical transfer 
pathway to the active site (Fig. 22–42c). A likely mech-
anism for the ribonucleotide reductase reaction is illus-
trated in Figure 22–43. In E. coli, the sources of the 
required reducing equivalents for this reaction are thio-
redoxin and glutaredoxin, as noted above.
 
Three classes of ribonucleotide reductase have been 
reported. Their mechanisms (where known) generally 
conform to the scheme in Figure 22–43, but they differ in 
the identity of the group supplying the active-site radical 
and in the cofactors used to generate it. The E. coli

MECHANISM FIGURE 22–43 Proposed mechanism for ribonucleotide 
reductase. In the enzyme of E. coli and most eukaryotes, the active thiol 
groups are on the  subunit; the active-site radical (—X•) is on the  
subunit and in E. coli is probably a thiyl radical of Cys439 (see Fig. 22–42).
22.4 Biosynthesis and Degradation of Nucleotides 
919
dNTPs is signaled by high levels of dTTP, which shifts 
the specificity to favor reduction of GDP. High levels 
of dGTP, in turn, shift the specificity to ADP reduc-
tion, and high levels of dATP shut the enzyme down. 
These effectors are thought to induce several distinct 
enzyme conformations with altered specificities.
 
These regulatory effects are accompanied by, and 
presumably mediated by, large structural rearrange-
ments in the enzyme. When the active form of the 
E. coli enzyme (22) is inhibited by the addition of 
the allosteric inhibitor dATP, a ringlike 44 structure 
forms, with alternating 2 and 2 subunits (Fig. 22–45). 
In this altered structure, the radical-forming path from 
 to  is disrupted and the residues in the path are 
site (Fig. 22–42). One type affects overall enzyme 
activity and binds either ATP, which activates the 
enzyme, or dATP, which inactivates it. The second 
type alters substrate specificity in response to the 
effector molecule—ATP, dATP, dTTP, or dGTP—that 
is bound there (Fig. 22–44). When ATP or dATP is 
bound, reduction of UDP and CDP is favored. When 
dTTP or dGTP is bound, reduction of GDP or ADP, 
respectively, is stimulated. The scheme is designed to 
provide a balanced pool of precursors for DNA synthe-
sis. ATP is also a general activator for biosynthesis 
and ribonucleotide reduction. The presence of dATP 
in small amounts increases the reduction of pyrimi-
dine nucleotides. An oversupply of the pyrimidine 
FIGURE 22–44 Regulation of ribonucleotide reductase by deoxynucleo-
side triphosphates. The overall activity of the enzyme is affected by 
binding at the primary regulatory site (left). The substrate specificity of 
the enzyme is affected by the nature of the effector molecule bound at 
the second type of regulatory site, the substrate-specificity site (right). 
The diagram indicates inhibition or stimulation of enzyme activity with 
the four different substrates. The pathway from dUDP to dTTP is 
described later (see Figs. 22–46, 22–47).
FIGURE 22–45 Oligomerization of ribonucleotide reductase induced by 
the allosteric inhibitor dATP. In high concentrations of dATP (50 M), 
ring-shaped 44 structures form (PDB ID 3UUS). In this conformation, 
the residues in the radical-forming path are exposed to the solvent, 
blocking the radical reaction and inhibiting the enzyme. The oligomeriza-
tion is reversed at lower dATP concentrations.

exposed to solvent, effectively preventing radical trans-
fer and thus inhibiting the reaction. The formation of 
ringlike 44 structures is reversed when dATP levels 
are reduced. The yeast ribonucleotide reductase also 
undergoes oligomerization in the presence of dATP, 
forming a hexameric ring structure, 66.
Thymidylate Is Derived from dCDP and dUMP
DNA contains thymine rather than uracil, and the de 
novo pathway to thymine involves only deoxyribonucle-
otides. The immediate precursor of thymidylate (dTMP) 
is dUMP. In bacteria, the pathway to dUMP begins with 
formation of dUTP, either by deamination of dCTP or by 
phosphorylation of dUDP (Fig. 22–46). The dUTP is 
converted to dUMP by a dUTPase. The latter reaction 
must be efficient to keep dUTP pools low and prevent 
incorporation of uridylate into DNA.
 
Conversion of dUMP to dTMP is catalyzed by thy-
midylate synthase. A one-carbon unit at the hydroxy-
methyl (—CH2OH) oxidation level (see Fig. 18–17) is 
transferred from N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 
dUMP, then reduced to a methyl group (Fig. 22–47). 
The reduction occurs at the expense of oxidation of 
tetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate, which is unusual in 
tetrahydrofolate-requiring reactions. (The mechanism 
of this reaction is shown in Fig. 22–53.) The dihydro-
folate is reduced to tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate 
reductase—a regeneration that is essential for the 
many processes that require tetrahydrofolate. In plants 
and at least one protist, thymidylate synthase and 
dihydrofolate reductase reside on a single bifunctional 
protein.
About 10% of the human population (and up to 
50% of people in impoverished communities) 
suffers from folic acid deficiency. When the deficiency 
is severe, the symptoms can include heart disease, can-
cer, and some types of brain dysfunction. At least some 
of these symptoms arise from a reduction of thymi-
dylate synthesis, leading to an abnormal incorporation 
of uracil into DNA. Uracil is recognized by DNA repair 
pathways (described in Chapter 25) and is cleaved from 
the DNA. The presence of high levels of uracil in DNA 
leads to strand breaks that can greatly affect the func-
tion and regulation of nuclear DNA, ultimately causing 
the observed effects on the heart and brain, as well as 
increased mutagenesis that leads to cancer. ■
Degradation of Purines and Pyrimidines Produces 
Uric Acid and Urea, Respectively
Purine nucleotides are degraded by a pathway in which 
they lose their phosphate through the action of 
59-nucleotidase (Fig. 22–48). Adenylate yields 
adenosine, which is deaminated to inosine by adenos-
ine deaminase, and inosine is hydrolyzed to hypoxan-
thine (its purine base) and D-ribose. Hypoxanthine is

oxidized successively to xanthine and then uric acid by 
xanthine oxidase, a flavoenzyme with an atom of 
molybdenum and four iron-sulfur centers in its pros-
thetic group. Molecular oxygen is the electron acceptor 
in this complex reaction.
 
GMP catabolism also yields uric acid as end prod-
uct. GMP is first hydrolyzed to guanosine, which is 
then cleaved to free guanine. Guanine undergoes 
hydrolytic removal of its amino group to yield xan-
thine, which is converted to uric acid by xanthine oxi-
dase (Fig. 22–48).
 
Uric acid is the excreted end product of purine 
catabolism in primates, birds, and some other animals. 
A healthy adult human excretes uric acid at a rate of 
about 0.6 g/24 h; the excreted product arises in part 
from ingested purines and in part from turnover of the

FIGURE 22–48 Catabolism of purine nucleotides. Note that primates

purine nucleotides of nucleic acids. In most mammals 
and many other vertebrates, uric acid is further degraded 
to allantoin by the action of urate oxidase. In other 
organisms the pathway is further extended, as shown in 
Figure 22–48.
 
The pathways for degradation of pyrimidines 
generally lead to NH
4  production and thus to urea 
synthesis. Thymine, for example, is degraded to 
methylmalonylsemialdehyde (Fig. 22–49), an inter-
mediate of valine catabolism. It is further degraded 
through propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA to 
succinyl-CoA (see Fig. 18–27).
Genetic aberrations in human purine metabolism 
have been found, some with serious consequences.

Purine and Pyrimidine Bases Are Recycled 
by Salvage Pathways
Free purine and pyrimidine bases are constantly 
released in cells during the metabolic degradation of 
nucleotides. Free purines are in large part salvaged and 
reused to make nucleotides, in a pathway much simpler 
than the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides 
described earlier. One of the primary salvage pathways 
consists of a single reaction catalyzed by adenosine 
phosphoribosyltransferase, in which free adenine 
reacts with PRPP to yield the corresponding adenine 
nucleotide:
Adenine 1 PRPP ¡ AMP 1 PPi
Free guanine and hypoxanthine (the deamination prod-
uct of adenine; Fig. 22–48) are salvaged in the same way 
by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransfer-
ase. A similar salvage pathway exists for pyrimidine 
bases in microorganisms, and possibly in mammals.
A genetic lack of hypoxanthine-guanine phospho-
ribosyltransferase activity, seen almost exclusive-
ly in male children, results in a bizarre set of symptoms 
called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Children with this 
genetic disorder, which becomes manifest by the age of 2 
years, are sometimes poorly coordinated and have intel-
lectual deficits. In addition, they are extremely hostile and 
show compulsive self-destructive tendencies: they muti-
late themselves by biting off their fingers, toes, and lips.
 
The devastating effects of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome 
illustrate the importance of the salvage pathways. 
Hypoxanthine and guanine arise constantly from the 
breakdown of nucleic acids. In the absence of hypoxan-
thine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, PRPP levels 
rise and purines are overproduced by the de novo path-
way, resulting in high levels of uric acid production and 
goutlike damage to tissue (see below). The brain is 
especially dependent on the salvage pathways, and this 
may account for the central nervous system damage in 
children with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This syndrome is 
another potential target for gene therapy. ■
Excess Uric Acid Causes Gout
Long thought (erroneously) to be due to “high 
living,” gout is a disease of the joints caused by 
an elevated concentration of uric acid in the blood and 
tissues. The joints become inflamed, painful, and arthritic, 
owing to the abnormal deposition of sodium urate crys-
tals. The kidneys are also affected, as excess uric acid is 
deposited in the kidney tubules. Gout occurs predomi-
nantly in males. Its precise cause is not known, but it 
often involves an underexcretion of urate. A genetic 
deficiency of one or another enzyme of purine metabo-
lism may also be a factor in some cases.
 
Gout is effectively treated by a combination of 
nutritional and drug therapies. Foods especially rich in 
nucleotides and nucleic acids, such as liver or glandular 
products, are withheld from the diet. Major alleviation 
which T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes do not develop 
properly. Lack of ADA leads to a 100-fold increase in the 
cellular concentration of dATP, a strong inhibitor of ribo-
nucleotide reductase (Fig. 22–44). High levels of dATP 
produce a general deficiency of other dNTPs in T lym-
phocytes. The basis for B-lymphocyte toxicity is less 
clear. Individuals with ADA deficiency lack an effective 
immune system and do not survive unless isolated in a 
sterile “bubble” environment. ADA deficiency was one of 
the first targets of human gene therapy trials (in 1990), 
which yielded mixed results. In more recent trials, some 
ADA-deficient individuals regained normal immune 
function after being given a functional gene for ADA. ■

of the symptoms is provided by the drug allopurinol 
(Fig. 22–50), which inhibits xanthine oxidase, the 
enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of purines to uric 
acid. Allopurinol is a substrate of xanthine oxidase, 
which converts allopurinol to oxypurinol (alloxanthine). 
Oxypurinol inactivates the reduced form of the enzyme 
by remaining tightly bound in its active site. When xan-
thine oxidase is inhibited, the excreted products of 
purine metabolism are xanthine and hypoxanthine, 
which are more water-soluble than uric acid and less 
likely to form crystalline deposits. Allopurinol was 
developed by Gertrude Elion and George Hitchings, 
who also developed acyclovir, used in treating people 
with genital and oral herpes infections, and other purine 
analogs used in cancer chemotherapy. ■
Many Chemotherapeutic Agents Target Enzymes 
in the Nucleotide Biosynthetic Pathways
The growth of cancer cells is not controlled in 
the same way as cell growth in most normal tis-
sues. Cancer cells have greater requirements for 
nucleotides as precursors of DNA and RNA, and con-
sequently are generally more sensitive than normal 
cells to inhibitors of nucleotide biosynthesis. A grow-
ing array of important chemotherapeutic agents—for 
cancer and other diseases—act by inhibiting one or 
more enzymes in these pathways. We describe here 
several well-studied examples that illustrate produc-
tive approaches to treatment and help us understand 
how these enzymes work.
 
The first set of agents includes compounds that 
inhibit glutamine amidotransferases. Recall that gluta-
mine is a nitrogen donor in at least half a dozen sepa-
rate reactions in nucleotide biosynthesis. The binding 
sites for glutamine and the mechanism by which NH
4 is 
extracted are quite similar in many of these enzymes. 
Most are strongly inhibited by glutamine analogs such 
as azaserine and acivicin (Fig. 22–51). Azaserine, 
characterized by John Buchanan in the 1950s, was one 
of the first examples of a mechanism-based enzyme 
inactivator (suicide inactivator; p. 210 and Box 6–3). 
Acivicin shows promise as a cancer chemotherapeutic 
agent.
 
Other useful targets for pharmaceutical agents are 
thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase, 
enzymes that provide the only cellular pathway for 
thymine synthesis (Fig. 22–52). One inhibitor that 
acts on thymidylate synthase, fluorouracil, is an 
important chemotherapeutic agent. Fluorouracil itself 
is not the enzyme inhibitor. In the cell, salvage path-
ways convert it to the deoxynucleoside monophos-
phate FdUMP, which binds to and inactivates the 
enzyme. Inhibition by FdUMP (Fig. 22–53) is a classic 
example of mechanism-based enzyme inactivation. 
Another prominent chemotherapeutic agent, metho-
trexate, is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase.

tightly bound to the reduced form of the enzyme.

tic agents. (b) Fluorouracil and methotrexate are important chemother-
apeutic agents. In cells, fluorouracil is converted to FdUMP, which inhib-

tetrahydrofolate, inhibits dihydrofolate reductase; the shaded amino and 
methyl groups replace a carbonyl oxygen and a proton, respectively, in 
folate (see Fig. 22–47). Another important folate analog, aminopterin, is 
identical to methotrexate except that it lacks the shaded methyl group.

tase, was developed as an antibiotic.

MECHANISM FIGURE 22–53 Conversion of dUMP to dTMP and its inhi-
bition by FdUMP. The left side is the normal reaction mechanism of 
thymidylate synthase. The nucleophilic sulfhydryl group contributed by 
the enzyme in 1 and the ring atoms of dUMP taking part in the reac-
tion are shown in red; :B denotes an amino acid side chain that acts as 
a base to abstract a proton after step 3. The hydrogens derived from 
the methylene group of N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate are shaded in 
gray. The 1,3 hydride shift (step 4), moves a hydride ion (shaded light 
red) from C-6 of H4 folate to the methyl group of thymidine, resulting 
in the oxidation of tetrahydrofolate to dihydrofolate. This hydride shift 
is blocked when FdUMP is the substrate (right). Steps 1 and 2 pro-
ceed normally, but result in a stable complex—consisting of FdUMP 
linked covalently to the enzyme and to tetrahydrofolate—that inacti-
vates the enzyme.

This folate analog acts as a competitive inhibitor; the 
enzyme binds methotrexate with about 100 times 
higher affinity than dihydrofolate. Aminopterin is a 
related compound that acts similarly.
 
The medical potential of inhibitors of nucleotide 
biosynthesis is not limited to cancer treatment. All 
fast-growing cells (including bacteria and protists) are 
potential targets. Trimethoprim, an antibiotic devel-
oped by Hitchings and Elion, binds to bacterial dihy-
drofolate reductase nearly 100,000 times better than 
to the mammalian enzyme. It is used to treat certain 
urinary and middle-ear bacterial infections. Parasitic 
protists, such as the trypanosomes that cause African 
sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis), lack 
pathways for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis and are 
particularly sensitive to agents that interfere with their 
scavenging of nucleotides from the surrounding envi-
ronment using salvage pathways. Allopurinol (Fig. 
22–50) and several similar purine analogs have shown 
promise for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis 
and related afflictions. See Box 6–3 for another 
approach to combating African trypanosomiasis, made 
possible by advances in our understanding of metabo-
lism and enzyme mechanisms. ■
SUMMARY 22.4 Biosynthesis and Degradation of 
Nucleotides
 The purine ring system is built up step-by-step 
beginning with 5-phosphoribosylamine. The amino 
acids glutamine, glycine, and aspartate furnish all 
the nitrogen atoms of purines. Two ring-closure 
steps form the purine nucleus.
 Pyrimidines are synthesized from carbamoyl 
phosphate and aspartate, and ribose 5-phosphate 
is then attached to yield the pyrimidine 
ribonucleotides.
 Nucleoside monophosphates are converted to their 
triphosphates by enzymatic phosphorylation 
reactions. Ribonucleotides are converted to 
deoxyribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase, 
an enzyme with novel mechanistic and regulatory 
characteristics. The thymine nucleotides are 
derived from dCDP and dUMP.
 Uric acid and urea are the end products of purine 
and pyrimidine degradation.
 Free purines can be salvaged and rebuilt into 
nucleotides. Genetic deficiencies in certain salvage 
enzymes cause serious disorders such as Lesch-
Nyhan syndrome and ADA deficiency.
 Accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints, 
possibly caused by another genetic deficiency, 
results in gout.
 Enzymes of the nucleotide biosynthetic pathways 
are targets for an array of chemotherapeutic 
agents used to treat cancer and other diseases.

The bacterium Methylophilus methylotrophus can synthe-
size protein from methanol and ammonia. Recombinant DNA 
techniques have improved the yield of protein by introducing 
into M. methylotrophus the glutamate dehydrogenase gene 
from E. coli. Why does this genetic manipulation increase the 
protein yield?

Problems 
11. Nucleotide Biosynthesis in Amino Acid Auxo-
trophic Bacteria Wild-type E. coli cells can synthesize 
all 20 common amino acids, but some mutants, called 
amino acid auxotrophs, are unable to synthesize a specific 
amino acid and require its addition to the culture medium 
for optimal growth. Besides their role in protein synthesis, 
some amino acids are also precursors for other nitroge-
nous cell products. Consider the three amino acid auxo-
trophs that are unable to synthesize glycine, glutamine, 
and aspartate, respectively. For each mutant, what nitrog-
enous products other than proteins would the cell fail to 
synthesize?
12. Inhibitors of Nucleotide Biosynthesis Suggest 
mechanisms for the inhibition of (a) alanine racemase by 
L-fluoroalanine and (b) glutamine amidotransferases by 
azaserine.
13. Mode of Action of Sulfa Drugs Some bacteria 
require p-aminobenzoate in the culture medium for 
normal growth, and their growth is severely inhibited by the 
addition of sulfanilamide, one of the earliest sulfa drugs. More-
over, in the presence of this drug, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carbox-
amide ribonucleotide (AICAR; see Fig. 22–35) accumulates in 
the culture medium. These effects are reversed by addition of 
excess p-aminobenzoate.

(c) Why are the inhibition and accumulation reversed by 
addition of excess p-aminobenzoate?
14. Pathway of Carbon in Pyrimidine Biosynthesis Pre-
dict the locations of 14C in orotate isolated from cells grown on 
a small amount of uniformly labeled [14C]succinate. Justify 
your prediction.
15. Nucleotides as Poor Sources of Energy Under starva-
tion conditions, organisms can use proteins and amino acids as 
sources of energy. Deamination of amino acids produces car-
bon skeletons that can enter the glycolytic pathway and the 
citric acid cycle to produce energy in the form of ATP. Nucle-
otides, on the other hand, are not similarly degraded for use as 
energy-yielding fuels. What observations about cellular physi-
ology support this statement? What aspect of the structure of 
nucleotides makes them a relatively poor source of energy?
16. Treatment of Gout Allopurinol (see Fig. 22–50), 
an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase, is used to treat chron-
ic gout. Explain the biochemical basis for this treatment. 
Patients treated with allopurinol sometimes develop xanthine 
stones in the kidneys, although the incidence of kidney dam-
age is much lower than in untreated gout. Explain this obser-
vation in the light of the following solubilities in urine: uric 
acid, 0.15 g/L; xanthine, 0.05 g/L; and hypoxanthine, 1.4 g/L.
from the  carbon of an amino acid. The enzyme threonine 
synthase (see Fig. 22–17) promotes the PLP-dependent con-
version of phosphohomoserine to threonine. Suggest a mecha-
nism for this reaction.
4. Transformation of Aspartate to Asparagine There 
are two routes for transforming aspartate to asparagine at 
the expense of ATP. Many bacteria have an asparagine syn-
thetase that uses ammonium ion as the nitrogen donor. Mam-
mals have an asparagine synthetase that uses glutamine as the 
nitrogen donor. Given that the latter requires an extra ATP (for 
the synthesis of glutamine), why do mammals use this route?
5. Equation for the Synthesis of Aspartate from Glucose 
Write the net equation for the synthesis of aspartate (a nones-
sential amino acid) from glucose, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.
6. Asparagine Synthetase Inhibitors in Leukemia 
Therapy Mammalian asparagine synthetase is a 
glutamine-dependent amidotransferase. Efforts to identify an 
effective inhibitor of human asparagine synthetase for use in 
chemotherapy for patients with leukemia has focused not on 
the amino-terminal glutaminase domain but on the carboxyl-
terminal synthetase active site. Explain why the glutaminase 
domain is not a promising target for a useful drug.
7. Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Deficiency and Diet 
Tyrosine is normally a nonessential amino acid, but individuals 
with a genetic defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase require 
tyrosine in their diet for normal growth. Explain.
8. Cofactors for One-Carbon Transfer Reactions 
Most one-carbon transfers are promoted by one of three 
cofactors: biotin, tetrahydrofolate, or S-adenosylmethio-
nine (Chapter 18). S-Adenosylmethionine is generally used 
as a methyl group donor; the transfer potential of the 
methyl group in N5-methyltetrahydrofolate is insufficient 
for most biosynthetic reactions. However, one example of 
the use of N5-methyltetrahydrofolate in methyl group 
transfer is in methionine formation by the methionine syn-
thase reaction (step 9 of Fig. 22–17); methionine is the 
immediate precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (see Fig. 
18–18). Explain how the methyl group of S-adenosylme-
thionine can be derived from N5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 
even though the transfer potential of the methyl group in 
N5-methyltetrahydrofolate is one-thousandth of that in 
S-adenosylmethionine.
9. Concerted Regulation in Amino Acid Biosynthesis 
The glutamine synthetase of E. coli is independently modulated 
by various products of glutamine metabolism (see Fig. 22–8). 
In this concerted inhibition, the extent of enzyme inhibition is 
greater than the sum of the separate inhibitions caused by each 
product. For E. coli grown in a medium rich in histidine, what 
would be the advantage of concerted inhibition?
10. Relationship between Folic Acid Deficiency 
and Anemia Folic acid deficiency, believed to be the 
most common vitamin deficiency, causes a type of anemia in 
which hemoglobin synthesis is impaired and erythrocytes do 
not mature properly. What is the metabolic relationship 
between hemoglobin synthesis and folic acid deficiency?

17. Inhibition of Nucleotide Synthesis by Azaserine 
The diazo compound O-(2-diazoacetyl)-L-serine, known also 
as azaserine (see Fig. 22–51), is a powerful inhibitor of 
glutamine amidotransferases. If growing cells are treated with 
azaserine, what intermediates of nucleotide biosynthesis will 
accumulate? Explain.
Data Analysis Problem
18. Use of Modern Molecular Techniques to Determine 
the Synthetic Pathway of a Novel Amino Acid Most of 
the biosynthetic pathways described in this chapter were 
determined before the development of recombinant DNA 
technology and genomics, so the techniques were quite differ-
ent from those that researchers would use today. Here we 
explore an example of the use of modern molecular tech-
niques to investigate the pathway of synthesis of a novel 
amino acid, (2S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA). The 
techniques mentioned here are described in various places in 
the book; this problem is designed to show how they can be 
integrated in a comprehensive study.
AHBA is a -amino acid that is a component of some 
aminoglycoside antibiotics, including the antibiotic butirosin. 
Antibiotics modified by the addition of an AHBA residue are 
often more resistant to inactivation by bacterial antibiotic-
resistance enzymes. As a result, understanding how AHBA is 
synthesized and added to antibiotics is useful in the design of 
pharmaceuticals.
In an article published in 2005, Li and coworkers describe 
how they determined the synthetic pathway of AHBA from 
glutamate.

(a) Briefly describe the chemical transformations needed 
to convert glutamate to AHBA. At this point, don’t be con-
cerned about the order of the reactions.
Li and colleagues began by cloning the butirosin biosyn-
thetic gene cluster from the bacterium Bacillus circulans, 
which makes large quantities of butirosin. They identified five 
genes that are essential for the pathway: btrI, btrJ, btrK, btrO, 
and btrV. They cloned these genes into E. coli plasmids that 
allow overexpression of the genes, producing proteins with 
“histidine tags” fused to their amino termini to facilitate purifi-
cation (see Section 9.1).
The predicted amino acid sequence of the BtrI protein 
showed strong homology to known acyl carrier proteins 
(see Fig. 21–5). Using mass spectrometry, Li and colleagues 
found a molecular mass of 11,812 for the purified BtrI protein 
(including the His tag). When the purified BtrI was incubated 
with coenzyme A and an enzyme known to attach CoA to other 
acyl carrier proteins, the majority molecular species had an 
Mr of 12,153.
(b) How would you use these data to argue that BtrI can 
function as an acyl carrier protein with a CoA prosthetic 
group?
Using standard terminology, Li and coauthors called the 
form of the protein lacking CoA apo-BtrI and the form with 
CoA (linked as in Fig. 21–5) holo-BtrI. When holo-BtrI was 
incubated with glutamine, ATP, and purified BtrJ protein, the 
holo-BtrI species of Mr 12,153 was replaced with a species of 
Mr 12,281, corresponding to the thioester of glutamate and 
holo-BtrI. Based on these data, the authors proposed the fol-
lowing structure for the Mr 12,281 species (-glutamyl-S-BtrI):
-Glutamyl-S-BtrI
BtrI

(c) What other structure(s) is (are) consistent with the 
data above?
(d) Li and coauthors argued that the structure shown 
here (-glutamyl-S-BtrI) is likely to be correct because the 
-carboxyl group must be removed at some point in the syn-
thetic process. Explain the chemical basis of this argument. 
(Hint: See Fig. 18–6, reaction C.)
The BtrK protein showed significant homology to PLP-
dependent amino acid decarboxylases, and BtrK isolated from 
E. coli was found to contain tightly bound PLP. When 
-glutamyl-S-BtrI was incubated with purified BtrK, a molecu-
lar species of Mr 12,240 was produced.
(e) What is the most likely structure of this species?
(f) Interestingly, when the investigators incubated gluta-
mate and ATP with purified BtrI, BtrJ, and BtrK, they found a 
molecular species of Mr 12,370. What is the most likely struc-
ture of this species? Hint: Remember that BtrJ can use ATP to 
-glutamylate nucleophilic groups.
Li and colleagues found that BtrO is homologous to 
monooxygenase enzymes (see Box 21–1) that hydroxylate 
alkanes, using FMN as a cofactor, and BtrV is homologous to 
an NAD(P)H oxidoreductase. Two other genes in the cluster, 
btrG and btrH, probably encode enzymes that remove the 
-glutamyl group and attach AHBA to the target antibiotic 
molecule.
(g) Based on these data, propose a plausible pathway for 
the synthesis of AHBA and its addition to the target antibiotic. 
Include the enzymes that catalyze each step and any other 
substrates or cofactors needed (ATP, NAD, etc.).
