# Biosynthesis of Amino Acids
 All amino acids are derived from intermediates in glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, or the pentose phosphate 
pathway (Fig. 22–11). Nitrogen enters these pathways 
by way of glutamate and glutamine. Some pathways 
are simple, others are not. Ten of the amino acids are 
just one or several steps removed from the common 
metabolite from which they are derived. The biosynthetic pathways for others, such as the aromatic 
amino acids, are more complex.

 Organisms vary greatly in their ability to synthesize the 20 common amino acids. Whereas most bacte
ria and plants can synthesize all 20, mammals can 
synthesize only about half of them—generally those with simple pathways. These are the nonessential 
amino acids, not needed in the diet (see Table 18–1). 
The remainder, the essential amino acids, must be 
obtained from food. Unless otherwise indicated, the 
pathways for the 20 common amino acids presented 
below are those operative in bacteria.

 A useful way to organize these biosynthetic pathways 
is to group them into six families corresponding to their 
metabolic precursors (Table 22–1), and we use this 
approach to structure the detailed descriptions that follow. 
In addition to these six precursors, there is a notable inter
mediate in several pathways of amino acid and nucleotide 
synthesis: 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP):
PRPP is synthesized from ribose 5-phosphate derived 
from the pentose phosphate pathway (see Fig. 14–22), 
in a reaction catalyzed by ribose phosphate pyro
phosphokinase:
 Ribose 5-phosphate 1 ATP ¡ 
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate 1 AMP
 This enzyme is allosterically regulated by many of the 
biomolecules for which PRPP is a precursor.

## α-Ketoglutarate Gives Rise to Glutamate, Glutamine, Proline, and Arginine

We have already described the biosynthesis of glutamate and glutamine. Proline is a cyclized derivative 
of glutamate (Fig. 22–12). In the first step of proline 
synthesis, ATP reacts with the -carboxyl group of glutamate to form an acyl phosphate, which is reduced by 
NADPH or NADH to glutamate -semialdehyde. This 
intermediate undergoes rapid spontaneous cyclization 
and is then reduced further to yield proline.

 Arginine is synthesized from glutamate via ornithine 
and the urea cycle in animals (Chapter 18). In principle, 
ornithine could also be synthesized from glutamate -semi
aldehyde by transamination, but the spontaneous cyclization of the semialdehyde in the proline pathway precludes a sufficient supply of this intermediate for ornithine 
synthesis. Bacteria have a de novo biosynthetic pathway 
for ornithine (and thus arginine) that parallels some steps 
of the proline pathway but includes two additional steps  that avoid the problem of the spontaneous cyclization of 
glutamate -semialdehyde (Fig. 22–12). In the first step, 
the -amino group of glutamate is blocked by an acetylation requiring acetyl-CoA; then, after the transamination 
step, the acetyl group is removed to yield ornithine.

 The pathways to proline and arginine are somewhat 
different in mammals. Proline can be synthesized by the 
pathway shown in Figure 22–12, but it is also formed 
from arginine obtained from dietary or tissue protein. 
Arginase, a urea cycle enzyme, converts arginine to ornithine and urea (see Figs 18–10, 18–26). The ornithine is 
converted to glutamate -semialdehyde by the enzyme 
ornithine -aminotransferase (Fig. 22–13). The 
semialdehyde cyclizes to 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, 
which is then converted to proline (Fig. 22–12). The 
pathway for arginine synthesis shown in Figure 22–12 is 
absent in mammals. When arginine from dietary intake 
or protein turnover is insufficient for protein synthesis, 
the ornithine -aminotransferase reaction operates in 
the direction of ornithine formation. Ornithine is then 
converted to citrulline and arginine in the urea cycle.

## Serine, Glycine, and Cysteine Are Derived from 3-Phosphoglycerate

The major pathway for the formation of serine is the 
same in all organisms (Fig. 22–14). In the first step, the 
hydroxyl group of 3-phosphoglycerate is oxidized by a 
dehydrogenase (using NAD) to yield 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate. Transamination from glutamate yields 
3-phosphoserine, which is hydrolyzed to free serine by 
phosphoserine phosphatase. 

Serine (three carbons) is the precursor of glycine 
(two carbons) through removal of a carbon atom by 
serine hydroxymethyltransferase (Fig. 22–14). Tetrahydrofolate accepts the  carbon (C-3) of serine, 
which forms a methylene bridge between N-5 and 
N-10 to yield N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (see 
Fig. 18–17). The overall reaction, which is reversible, 
also requires pyridoxal phosphate. In the liver of vertebrates, glycine can be made by another route: the 
reverse of the reaction shown in Figure 18–20c, catalyzed by glycine synthase (also called glycine cleavage 
enzyme):
 CO2 1 NH4 1 N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate 1 
  NADH 1 H ¡ glycine 1 tetrahydrofolate 1 NAD

 Plants and bacteria produce the reduced sulfur 
required for the synthesis of cysteine (and methionine, described later) from environmental sulfates; the 
pathway is shown on the right side of Figure 22–15. 
Sulfate is activated in two steps to produce 39-phospho
adenosine 59-phosphosulfate (PAPS), which undergoes 
an eight-electron reduction to sulfide. The sulfide is 
then used in the formation of cysteine from serine in a 
two-step pathway. Mammals synthesize cysteine from 
two amino acids: methionine furnishes the sulfur atom, 
and serine furnishes the carbon skeleton. Methionine is 
first converted to S-adenosylmethionine (see Fig. 
18–18), which can lose its methyl group to any of a 
number of acceptors to form S-adenosylhomocysteine 
(adoHcy). This demethylated product is hydrolyzed to 
free homocysteine, which undergoes a reaction with 
serine, catalyzed by cystathionine -synthase, to 
yield cystathionine (Fig. 22–16). Finally, cystathionine -lyase, a PLP-requiring enzyme, catalyzes 
removal of ammonia and cleavage of cystathionine to 
yield free cysteine. 

## Three Nonessential and Six Essential Amino Acids Are Synthesized from Oxaloacetate and Pyruvate

Alanine and aspartate are synthesized from pyruvate 
and oxaloacetate, respectively, by transamination from 
glutamate. Asparagine is synthesized by amidation of 
aspartate, with glutamine donating the NH4. These are 
nonessential amino acids, and their simple biosynthetic 
pathways occur in all organisms.

  For reasons incompletely understood, the malignant lymphocytes present in childhood acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) require serum asparagine 
for growth. The chemotherapy for ALL is administered 
together with an L-asparaginase derived from bacteria, with the enzyme functioning to reduce serum asparagine. The combined treatment results in a greater than 
95% remission rate in cases of childhood ALL (L-asparaginase treatment alone produces remission in 40% to  60% of cases). However, the asparaginase treatment has 
some deleterious side effects, and about 10% of patients 
who achieve remission eventually suffer relapse, with 
tumors resistant to drug therapy. Researchers are now developing inhibitors of human asparagine synthetase to 
augment these therapies for childhood ALL. ■
 Methionine, threonine, lysine, isoleucine, valine, 
and leucine are essential amino acids; humans cannot 
 synthesize them. Their biosynthetic pathways are com
plex and interconnected (Fig. 22–17). In some cases, 
the pathways in bacteria, fungi, and plants differ significantly. Figure 22–17 shows the bacterial pathways. 

Aspartate gives rise to methionine, threonine, 
and lysine. Branch points occur at aspartate -semialdehyde, an intermediate in all three pathways, and at 
homoserine, a precursor of threonine and methionine. 
Threonine, in turn, is one of the precursors of isoleucine. The valine and isoleucine pathways share four 
enzymes (Fig. 22–17, steps 
18 to 21). Pyruvate gives 
rise to valine and isoleucine in pathways that begin with 
condensation of two carbons of pyruvate (in the form of 
hydroxyethyl thiamine pyrophosphate; see Fig. 14–15) 
with another molecule of pyruvate (the valine path) 
or with -ketobutyrate (the isoleucine path). The -ketobutyrate is derived from threonine in a reaction 
that requires pyridoxal phosphate (Fig. 22–17, step 
17 ). An 
intermediate in the valine pathway, -ketoisovalerate, is 
the starting point for a four-step branch pathway leading to leucine (steps 
22 to 
25).

## Chorismate Is a Key Intermediate in the Synthesis of Tryptophan, Phenylalanine, and Tyrosine

Aromatic rings are not readily available in the environ
ment, even though the benzene ring is very stable. The 
branched pathway to tryptophan, phenylalanine, and 
tyrosine, occurring in bacteria, fungi, and plants, is the 
main biological route of aromatic ring formation. It proceeds through ring closure of an aliphatic precursor 
followed by stepwise addition of double bonds. The first 
four steps produce shikimate, a seven-carbon molecule 
derived from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate (Fig. 22–18). Shikimate is converted to chorismate in three steps that include the addition of three 
more carbons from another molecule of phosphoenolpyruvate. Chorismate is the first branch point of the 
pathway, with one branch leading to tryptophan, the 
other to phenylalanine and tyrosine.

 In the tryptophan branch (Fig. 22–19), chorismate is converted to anthranilate in a reaction in which 
glutamine donates the nitrogen that will become part of 
the indole ring. Anthranilate then condenses with 
PRPP. The indole ring of tryptophan is derived from the 
ring carbons and amino group of anthranilate plus two 
carbons derived from PRPP. The final reaction in the 
sequence is catalyzed by tryptophan synthase. This 
enzyme has an 2 2 subunit structure and can be dis
sociated into two  subunits and a 2 unit that catalyze 
different parts of the overall reaction:

 The second part of the reaction requires pyridoxal 
phosphate (Fig. 22–20). Indole formed in the first part 
is not released by the enzyme, but instead moves 
through a channel from the -subunit active site to one 
of the -subunit active sites, where it condenses with a 
Schiff base intermediate derived from serine and PLP. 
Intermediate channeling of this type may be a feature of 
the entire pathway from chorismate to tryptophan. 
Enzyme active sites catalyzing different steps (some
times not sequential steps) of the pathway to tryptophan are found on single polypeptides in some species 
of fungi and bacteria, but are separate proteins in other 
species. In addition, the activity of some of these 
enzymes requires a noncovalent association with other 
enzymes of the pathway. These observations suggest 
that all the pathway enzymes are components of a large, 
multienzyme complex in both bacteria and eukaryotes. 
Such complexes are generally not preserved intact 
when the enzymes are isolated using traditional biochemical methods, but evidence for the existence of 
multienzyme complexes is accumulating for this and 
other metabolic pathways (see Section 16.3).

 In plants and bacteria, phenylalanine and tyrosine are synthesized from chorismate in pathways 
much less complex than the tryptophan pathway. The 
common intermediate is prephenate (Fig. 22–21). 
The final step in both cases is transamination with 
glutamate.

 Animals can produce tyrosine directly from phenyl
alanine through hydroxylation at C-4 of the phenyl 
group by phenylalanine hydroxylase; this enzyme 
also participates in the degradation of phenylalanine 
(see Figs 18–23, 18–24). Tyrosine is considered a conditionally essential amino acid, or as nonessential inso
far as it can be synthesized from the essential amino 
acid phenylalanine.

## Histidine Biosynthesis Uses Precursors of Purine Biosynthesis

The pathway to histidine in all plants and bacteria differs in several respects from other amino acid biosyn
thetic pathways. Histidine is derived from three precursors (Fig. 22–22): PRPP contributes five carbons, the 
purine ring of ATP contributes a nitrogen and a carbon, 
and glutamine supplies the second ring nitrogen. The 
key steps are condensation of ATP and PRPP, in which  N-1 of the purine ring is linked to the activated C-1 of 
the ribose of PRPP (step 1 in Fig. 22–22); purine ring 
opening that ultimately leaves N-1 and C-2 of adenine 
linked to the ribose (step 3); and formation of the 
imidazole ring, a reaction in which glutamine donates a 
nitrogen (step 5). The use of ATP as a metabolite 
rather than a high-energy cofactor is unusual—but not 
wasteful, because it dovetails with the purine biosynthetic pathway. The remnant of ATP that is released 
after the transfer of N-1 and C-2 is 5-aminoimidazole-4
carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR), an intermediate 
of purine biosynthesis (see Fig. 22–35) that is rapidly 
recycled to ATP.

## Amino Acid Biosynthesis Is under Allosteric Regulation

 As detailed in Chapter 15, the control of flux through a 
metabolic pathway often reflects the activity of multiple 
enzymes in that pathway. In the case of amino acid syn
thesis, regulation takes place in part through feedback 
inhibition of the first reaction by the end product of the 
pathway. This first reaction is often catalyzed by an allosteric enzyme that plays an important role in the overall 
control of flux through that pathway. As an example, 
Figure 22–23 shows the allosteric regulation of isoleucine synthesis from threonine (detailed in Fig. 22–17). 

 The end product, isoleucine, is an allosteric inhibitor of 
the first reaction in the sequence. In bacteria, such allosteric modulation of amino acid synthesis contributes to 
the minute-to-minute adjustment of pathway activity to 
cellular needs.

 Allosteric regulation of an individual enzyme can be 
considerably more complex. An example is the remark
able set of allosteric controls exerted on glutamine 
synthetase of E. coli (Fig. 22–8). Six products derived 
from glutamine serve as negative feedback modulators 
of the enzyme, and the overall effects of these and other 
modulators are more than additive. Such regulation is 
called concerted inhibition.

 Additional mechanisms contribute to the regulation 
of the amino acid biosynthetic pathways. Because the 20 
common amino acids must be made in the correct pro
portions for protein synthesis, cells have developed ways 
not only of controlling the rate of synthesis of individual 
amino acids but also of coordinating their formation. 
Such coordination is especially well developed in fast
growing bacterial cells. Figure 22–24 shows how E. coli 
cells coordinate the synthesis of lysine, methionine, 
threonine, and isoleucine, all made from aspartate. Several important types of inhibition patterns are evident. 
The step from aspartate to aspartyl--phosphate is catalyzed by three isozymes, each independently controlled 
by different modulators. This enzyme multiplicity pre
vents one biosynthetic end product from shutting down 
key steps in a pathway when other products of the same 
pathway are required. The steps from aspartate -semialdehyde to homoserine and from threonine to -ketobutyrate (detailed in Fig. 22–17) are also catalyzed by dual, 
independently controlled isozymes. One isozyme for the 
conversion of aspartate to aspartyl--phosphate is allosterically inhibited by two different modulators, lysine 
and isoleucine, whose action is more than additive—
 another example of concerted inhibition. The sequence 
from aspartate to isoleucine undergoes multiple, overlap
ping negative feedback inhibitions; for example, isoleucine 
inhibits the conversion of threonine to -ketobutyrate 
(as described above), and threonine inhibits its own formation at three points: from homoserine, from aspartate -semialdehyde, and from aspartate (steps 4, 3, and 1 
in Fig. 22–17). This overall regulatory mechanism is 
called sequential feedback inhibition.

 Similar patterns are evident in the pathways leading to the aromatic amino acids. The first step of the  early pathway to the common intermediate chorismate 
is catalyzed by the enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-arabinoheptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase (1 in 
Fig. 22–18). Most microorganisms and plants have 
three DAHP synthase isozymes. One is allosterically 
inhibited (feedback inhibition) by phenylalanine, 
another by tyrosine, and the third by tryptophan. This 
scheme helps the overall pathway to respond to cellular requirements for one or more of the aromatic amino 
acids. Additional regulation takes place after the path
way branches at chorismate. For example, the enzymes 
catalyzing the first two steps of the tryptophan branch 
are subject to allosteric inhibition by tryptophan.

## SUMMARY 22.2 Biosynthesis of Amino Acids

 Plants and bacteria synthesize all 20 common 
amino acids. Mammals can synthesize about half; the others are required in the diet (essential amino 
acids).

 Among the nonessential amino acids, glutamate is 
formed by reductive amination of -ketoglutarate 
and serves as the precursor of glutamine, proline, 
and arginine. Alanine and aspartate (and thus 
asparagine) are formed from pyruvate and 
oxaloacetate, respectively, by transamination. The 
carbon chain of serine is derived from 
3-phosphoglycerate. Serine is a precursor of 
glycine; the -carbon atom of serine is transferred 
to tetrahydrofolate. In microorganisms, cysteine is 
produced from serine and from sulfide produced 
by the reduction of environmental sulfate. 
Mammals produce cysteine from methionine and 
serine by a series of reactions requiring 
S-adenosylmethionine and cystathionine.

 Among the essential amino acids, the aromatic 
amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and 
tryptophan) form by a pathway in which 
chorismate occupies a key branch point. 
Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate is a precursor of 
tryptophan and histidine. The pathway to 
histidine is interconnected with the purine 
synthetic pathway. Tyrosine can also be formed 
by hydroxylation of phenylalanine (and thus is 
considered conditionally essential). The 
pathways for the other essential amino acids are 
complex.

 The amino acid biosynthetic pathways are subject 
to allosteric end-product inhibition; the regulatory 
enzyme is usually the first in the sequence. 
Regulation of the various synthetic pathways is 
coordinated.
